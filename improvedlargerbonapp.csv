This recipe surprised me in the best way. Will make again, next time to impress a crowd. I’ll probably add more than the suggested amount of raisins. ,So so good! Subbed dates for the dried fruit but otherwise followed the recipe and plan to eat it all week. The balance between the pasta/sauce/meat/nuts is perfect and it's delicious.,Delicious. Made it exactly as written (kefir, pine nuts, golden raisins) and it turned out great. The dill and kefir are fresh and acidic while the lamb, nuts, and raisins add richness and sweetness.

I saved leftovers for the next day by separately storing the meat mixture and dill kefir mixture. I then just cooked more pasta, reheated the lamb, and assembled as directed.

Will definitely be making again. Would love to see more recipes from Sohla!,This is one of the best recipes I've ever made!! It's just not flavors I would normally use/ make - what a wonderful surprise!

I made it with a LOT of substitutions (#QuarantineLife), but still turned out great. Here are the things I swapped:
-Mix of Greek & regular yogurt instead of kefir
-Dried dill instead of fresh (I prob only used about closer to 1 cup)
-Slivered almonds instead of pine nuts
-Cranberries instead of currants 
-White fish instead of lamb (I wouldn't even know where to find lamb meat)

I will definitely make it again & highly recommend it ,Absolutely scrumptious. The explosion of flavours from all the components of the recipe made me regret that I only made half a batch. I've never had any pasta quite like it and will definitely be making this again. Also, I found your rec on the substitutes from your instagram stories extremely helpful.,Absolutely scrumptious. The explosion of flavours from all the components of the recipe made me regret that I only made half a batch. I've never had any pasta quite like it and will definitely be making this again. Also, I found your rec on the substitutes from your instagram stories extremely helpful.  ,So very tasty and a fun Friday night dinner. We will definitely be making again. It was very comforting but still bright, herby, and spring-like. ,Super easy and light pasta dish! Used alot of subs for what I had on hand, plain yogurt, almonds, dates, kale/leek in addition to dill. Also sauted shiitake mushrooms instead of lamb and was awesome! ,Loved this! Used Greek yogurt and added some of the pasta water (1.5 cup yogurt and .5 cup pasta water) to thin it out. Also replaced lamb with gardein crumbles. Will definitely make again and up the dill!,Took some substitutes:  used yogurt and sliced almonds.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  It was hearty yet refreshing!  Husband loved it, and I loved it.  Will be making it again!,So good! Subbed conchigliette for the pasta, and parsley, spinach, and Greek yogurt for the sauce. Making this again tonight~,So yummy!! Made some quarantine substitutions (parsley, walnuts, ground beef, penne) and it was delicious. More Sohla recipes, please!,This is delightful! Made the recipe as written, pine nuts and raisins, and it was perfect!,The article for this recipe says ""There’s whole-milk yogurt (or kefir plus egg yolks)..."" Are you supposed to use egg yolks with whole-milk yogurt?,We made this tonight - couldn't find orecchiette so substituted, but to no detriment. Delicious, will *for sure* make again. 

My wife hates raisins, and her only modification suggested is ""I can't believe it, but more raisins."",Sohla, this recipe is incredible. I saw the article this weekend and your recommended substitutions gave me an idea on how to use that buttermilk at the back of the fridge.

We substituted basically every major ingredient—buttermilk instead of yogurt, chives from the garden instead of dill, raw pistachios (From that absurdly good carrot cake in this month's paper magazine) instead of pine nut, golden raisin instead of currant, ground beef instead of lamb, and fancy shells from Aldi instead of Orecchiette) and it was still delicious?? and easy??? Magic.

Thank you so much—this is definitely going to be a staple.,This was a perfect quaratine recipe - easy to make substitutions while still creating a delicious & fun meal! ,Wonderful recipe! I made it with what I had on hand- cilantro, chorizo, cashews and roasted black beans. Came together fast and turned out wonderfully! I live for your recipes, Sohla, keep up the good work :),This recipe rules! Tastes so different and awesome and was super easy to put together. It took longer than 3 minutes for my sauce to come together but I upped the heat a tad and just kept stirring and it became gorgeous and glossy. ,This was so fun to make and I was really pleased with the outcome. I substituted pork for the lamb and thought it was successful. This will be a great recipe to pull out when I'm looking to mix up the pasta monotony!,Made this tonight with a couple substitutions (beef, mixed in some leftover pesto to the yogh mixture) and it was DELICIOUS! Loved it, will definitely make again. Thank you, Sohlae! X"
