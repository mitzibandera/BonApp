Crispy-Skin Salmon with Miso-Honey Sauce,"1 2"" piece fresh ginger,2 Tbsp. white miso,1 Tbsp. vegetable oil,1 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar,1 Tbsp. honey,1 Tbsp. sesame seeds,3 scallions,4 4–6-oz. skin-on salmon fillets,Kosher salt","Start by assembling the honey-miso sauce: Peel ,2"" piece ginger, with a spoon. (We find that a spoon is better for navigating the bumpy exterior of a knob of ginger than a vegetable peeler, but you do you.) Finely grate ginger with a Microplane into a small bowl.,Add ,2 Tbsp. miso,, ,1 Tbsp. oil,, ,1 Tbsp. vinegar,, ,1 Tbsp. honey,, and ,1 Tbsp. water, to the bowl with with the ginger. Whisk to combine and set aside. This is a great all-purpose sauce, so making extra wouldn't hurt! Use it to top grain bowls, roasted vegetables, or any other simply-cooked protein.,Heat a small skillet over medium. Toast ,1 Tbsp. sesame seeds,, tossing frequently, until seeds are a light golden color and slightly fragrant, about 2 minutes. Seeds you toast yourself are always going to be more flavorful than the ones you buy already toasted, but we won't judge if you don't feel like going the extra mile.,Trim the root ends from ,3 scallions, and thinly slice crosswise.,Lightly season the flesh of ,4 salmon fillets, on all sides with ,salt,. Place pieces skin side down in a cold—as in not preheated; you don't have to refrigerate it or anything—cast-iron skillet. (This might seem a little weird, but trust us—the skin will render nicely and get way more crispy this way.) Heat skillet over medium and let the salmon cook undisturbed for 5 minutes.,Press down lightly on flesh with a spatula to ensure all parts of the skin are making contact with the pan. At this point it should be opaque at least halfway up the flesh side. Continue to cook skin side down until fish is mostly opaque and skin is crispy, about 5 minutes longer. If the skin is still sticking to the pan at this point, don't try to un-stick it—you'll know that it's ready to flip when it releases on its own.,Using a fish spatula, gently flip the fillets, then remove the pan from the heat. Continue to cook off-heat (the pan will still be plenty hot) until flesh is juuuuuuuust cooked through, about 1 minute longer for regular-sized fillets, but very thick ones might take up to 3 minutes more—you can use a fork to flake the fish slightly to check for doneness; you're looking for the inside to be still a little pink and translucent.,Spoon miso-honey sauce onto a platter. Place salmon fillets skin side up on top of the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and scallions. Et voila! Dinner is served.","This was everything I had hoped it would be and more! So quick and easy to prep and cook, plus the sauce is just incredible. I served it with brown rice, and cooked up some bok choy, garlic shoots and sugar snap peas in soy sauce and garlic, which made for the perfect companions. Already looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow...,This was actually very easy and quick to make. It turned out to be the best salmon I have ever made!,Okay, so. The cold pan method didn't work for me, even though its worked before! I think my fatal flaw was using a stainless steel pan instead of nonstick (I don't own cast iron). Despite the skin largely sticking to the pan, the fish itself was cooked really well and the sauce was delicious. I'll be honest, I made this recipe in an effort to scare off a prospective roommate. The smell definitely did the job, so mission accomplished. However, I'd appreciate some tips as to how to avoid it in the future. It lingered in the apartment for several days after.,Yes, the cooking method worked and produced perfectly done salmon. However, the cooking time was considerably more than the 10 minutes recommended. I used a standard cast iron, black interior, Le Crueset pan. It took 15 minutes on the first side to get the skin to release and about 3 minutes on the other side. We live in MT and our trading post had 3 types of salmon including wild caught $32 per lb King, which I bought. It was about 1 3/4 inches at the thickest part. I would like to point out the the writer that these days home cooks have available infrared and instant read thermometers. So you don't need to be so vague about what constitutes medium heat and you could tell us what the internal temp of the fish should be. Using Medium on my Thermador gas range, the pan got to between 390F and 450F. The fish smoked a bit but the vent fan took most of it. I note there is still a bit of fish smell the morning after. Personally, I don't like to eat crispy (or any other type) of fish skin and prefer poached or roasted salmon (no smell). The sauce was great, however, to me, it overpowers the fish. But it is definitely worth a try. You might consider using it with grilled salmon. 
Bottom line I'd make it again as the fish came out great, despite the smell. And I might try a cheaper type of salmon that would benefit from a strong sauce. 
I would like to encourage all BA writers to be more precise with their heat settings and tell us what the internal temp of the final product should be. Thank you,Amazing crispy fish with an incredible sauce to accompany. Served it up with rice and charred broccoli and covered it all in the amazing sauce. Recipe is a super keeper!,Miso-Horney,This sauce though! I want to have it on EVERYTHING. I made the salmon for my husband and baked a piece of cod for myself. We had asparagus as our side and I doused everything with the sauce. Easy to make, I didn't have all of the specific ingredients on hand or at my grocery store, but it was very easy to substitute with what I could find.,KEEP THE SKIN FROM STICKING by patting the salmon 100% DRY before it goes in the pan.
Great recipe. Sauce takes longer than planned.
,Fabulous recipe. Made it exactly how it reads, but my salmon fillets were a little thick so I left them in the pan, off the heat, for a few minutes longer than the recipe suggested. I don't think I can go back to cooking salmon any other way, it's just so good.,This is one of the easiest recipes out there for salmon and it is delicious. The miso sauce tastes amazing with the salmon. I imagine the sauce can go with anything besides salmon. Will definitely make this again.,Incredibly easy and delicious.  Pairs perfectly with roasted asparagus or broccoli.  Will be added to our weekday dinner rotation for sure.  PS, to Anonymous in Portland - the recipe calls for a cast iron pan, not a stainless steel one.,I was nervous about the cold pan method but it worked wonderfully! I used a cast iron btw. I had to practice a lot of patience but the fillets really do release once they're ready. Quick and easy. I'll be bookmarking the miso sauce for other uses as well. ,This recipe is amazing - simple and delicious.  We normally grill salmon, but cooking it using this recipe produced a very moist fish. I was skeptical at first but this is a winner! Loved the sauce and very easy to make.,Overall the salmon tasted great, especially with the miso sauce! I did have some difficulty with the skin sticking to the pan. About half of the skin on each fillet fell off, and I followed the recipe exactly. I used a cold cast iron pan with no oil, as the recipe instructed. Despite the skin sticking I would definitely make this again!,Absolutely delicious and perfect exactly as written! This recipe makes you feel like a restaurant chef at home. It's also insanely quick - especially is you have one person on salmon duty and one person on sauce/scallion duty. Start to finish 15 min. meal. Going in the repertoire.,This was great. I cheated and added a little oil to my cast iron pan before proceeding with the cold pan method. Turned out great. Love the miso sauce and bought a small tub of miso specifically for this recipe.  (which is excellent without the ginger if you don’t have any on hand). No regrets ,I loved this! Ate it with charred broccoli and rice. Sauce was great, and this was such a fantastic way to make salmon - skin was super crispy and insides were tender. I didn't have an issue with it sticking to the pan -- maybe because I used a cast iron? I'll definitely make this again.,Not only did the skin stick to the pan, after letting it cook for 11 minutes waiting to see if it would release, but it also ruined my stainless steel pan.  Not happy.,I'm pretty new to cooking and this was the first time cooking any type of fish. Came out beautifully and the sauce was amazing and sweet without having really anything bad for you in it. 5/5,Super easy, extremely delicious! It's key to try to find fillets that are relatively even thickness for a consistent done-ness, unlike the stovetop-to-oven method. I was a bit dubious about this cold pan method, but it was  absolutely spot on just-cooked-tender. The miso sauce wasn't half bad either - served with roasted bok choy & carrots and jasmine rice. ,Simple, delicious and innovative"
Brown Butter–Basted Steak,"1 1¾""-thick bone-in rib eye (about 1½ lb.),Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper,2 tsp. vegetable oil,3 Tbsp. unsalted butter,2 sprigs rosemary,2 garlic cloves, crushed,Flaky sea salt","Season steak generously with kosher salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature 1 hour.,Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high, then add oil. As soon as oil is smoking, cook steak, turning every 2 minutes or so, until a deep brown crust forms and the internal temperature is a few degrees below your favored doneness (120°–125° for medium-rare), 8–10 minutes.,Add butter, rosemary, and garlic to skillet, tilt pan toward you so that butter pools on one side, and use a large spoon to continually baste steak with butter. Continue until butter is no longer bubbling and it smells nutty and is beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.

Found some NZ grass-fed Wagyu ribeyes on sale at the store and this simple recipe really did them justice. Loved it!  ,Amazing recipe!!!,Amazing recipe!"

Add onion and cook, stirring often, just until translucent, 6–8 minutes.,Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring often, until garlic is starting to turn golden, about 5 minutes.,Add ,5 tsp. curry powder, and ,½ tsp. cayenne, and cook, stirring constantly, until spices are aromatic and starting to stick to bottom of pot, about 1 minute.,Add ,13.5 oz. coconut milk, and stir to loosen spices, then stir in ,1 cup lentils,, ,½ cup shredded coconut,, ,2 tsp. salt,, and ,5 cups water,.,Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low to keep soup at a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lentils are broken down and soup is thickened, 25–30 minutes.,Meanwhile, remove ,10 oz. thawed frozen spinach, from packaging and squeeze between your hands over sink to remove excess water. Transfer to cutting board and coarsely chop.,Add spinach and ,15 oz. tomatoes, to pot and stir to combine. Taste and season with more salt. Simmer just to let flavors meld, about 5 minutes. Taste and season again with more salt.,FROZEN SPINACH: A SHORTCUT WE CAN TOTALLY GET BEHIND.,Ladle soup into bowls. Top with ,yogurt,, if desired.","While it's very interesting texturally, the soup doesn't really taste like much of anything. I added some vinegar and fish sauce to try and boost the flavour. ,Love love love this recipe! I also love adding zucchini at the end (5 min before serving) for a bit of crunch!,My whole family loved this soup! It had the perfect sting and the textures of the lentils, shredded coconuts and the spinach were on point. I added half of a lime to make it a little more tangy, highly recommend doing that!,I love the flavors of this soup! Maybe it was my knife skills, but I didn't love the texture of the pieces of ginger. I used an immersion blender to fix it and it's much better. I might leave the shredded coconut out next time and add more lentils. Overall I'm happy with the results and would make this again,This is a pandemic-friendly meal! So glad I found it.,Delicious, easy and not a huge amount of extra ingredients so it is very practical. Love it!,Aw I'm bummed I'm not in Arizona with you all! I didn't realize how much I'd miss your family! Give them all lots of love and sing your grandma happy birthday from me ;) Nana,I made this two days ago. I only used 2 inch piece of ginger and I thought it was more than enough. I also added the whole bag of lentils instead of just one cup and I thought it was very hearty. We had it two nights in a row it was so yummy. Such a great soup especially on a cold winter night.,Delicious, feel-good pantry-staple recipe. Kick of ginger is awesome (I chopped slightly larger than mince). Subbed green lentils no prob, served w/ big slice of toast. Think w/ potatoes would be quite good. ,Wow!!!! Quite spicy!!!,What a great recipe, Claire! The yogurt really rounds out the amazing flavors in this soup. I loved it so much, I brought the pot over to share with the whole famn damily and it was a hit! ,LOVE this soup! Recently discovered this recipe and I’ve made it at least 4 times. Very easy to make: one of my all-time favorite soups to make! ,I loved it ⁠— my girlfriend raved over it. Made it a little heartier with the addition of tofu (fried in the coconut oil) and a sprinkle of toasted curry chickpeas on top. The yogurt is a nice addition.,Delicious!! Added chunks of butternut squash and subbed frozen spinach for fresh kale.,So yummy! I've made this three times so far, and always had to riff on the proportions and/or ingredients a little depending on what I had available but it always turned out so well, whether i made it for one (myself) or for 15 (cooking for a job) or my family during the holidays, its been a crowd pleaser. I use vegetable broth instead of water, or use a mix which I think adds a more complex flavor. ,Red Lentil Soup in all varieties is quite wonderful. I do prefer to use chopped, steamed Escarole rather than spinach. I cook the Escarole separately and add it in when servings are reheating. Also I add Cooked Hull-less barley as servings are reheating. An egg can be dropped in and poached to add a protein. Normally I have made a soup like this with a vegetable broth base rather than coconut milk base. This will be an interesting change. Thank you for the fine version shared here!,AMAZING!!! I love this soup. I keep it frozen in my fridge and thaw it whenever I'm feeling the need for some cozy food. Tastes great without the yogurt, but it adds an amazing creaminess and tartness.,This is so so delicious! I can't handle too  much spice so i used a 1/4tsp cayenne instead of 1/2 and it has the perfect level of spiciness for me. ,This soup is absolutely delicious! I didn't have cayenne so I used red chili flakes which made it super spicy but in a good way. I also subbed kale for spinach which I think made it heartier. Next time, I'll use a bit less water (4 cups instead of 5) because I personally like my soup a little thicker.,I really enjoyed this recipe, it's really easy to make and very flavorful. Will definitely make again. ,I have been making this for over a year. It is one of our favorites. Instead of frozen spinach, I use fresh, and I also add two to three cups of butternut squash, which pairs really nicely with this. ,I would recommend using a low sodium veggie broth instead of water, the flavor felt too diluted towards the end. Also I would add chickpeas or other proteins to make this heartier. Overall, not a bad base,This soup is hearty in a bowl! It has an unexpected heat from the amount of curry and the cayenne so a little yogurt on top certainly helps. My partner isn't huge on coconut so I skipped the added flakes but don't feel like I am majorly missing out (though it would be extra delicious!). This is one of those dishes that is even better the next day.,Very tasty. Like another reviewer I used split Mung beans because. Had an over-abundance. Forgot to add the spinach but still good. I made it once before and just wilted fresh spinach into the soup at the very end. ,What a fantastic frugal recipe. We save this soup for when the cupboards are bare before a shop and rejoice with how well we eat that night. Thank you! "
One-Pot Baked Pasta with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe,"Kosher salt,12 ounces Fontina and/or aged cheddar cheese,6 garlic cloves,2 large sprigs sage,1 bunch of broccoli rabe,¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil,1 pound sweet or hot Italian sausage,½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes,2 cups half-and-half,1 pound ridged medium pasta shells, or large tube pasta, such as lumaconi or rigatoni","Place racks in center and upper third of oven; preheat to 325°. Heat a large pot of water over high. Add several tablespoons of ,salt, and bring to a boil (this is for your pasta).,Grate ,12 oz. Fontina cheese, on the large holds of a box grater (you should have about 4½ cups). Smash ,6 garlic cloves,, peel, and coarsely chop. Pick all ,sage leaves, from stems and set aside about 10.

Broil until cheese is browned and bubbling in spots, about 5 minutes (depending on strength of broiler).,Let pasta cool a minute or two before serving.","My sister and I made this for Mother's Day using vegetarian soya-based sausages and a more traditional roux, it was delicious!,Used a lot less oil to cook the sausage and sauce split a tiny bit but not too badly. I also didn’t have any sage so I used Italian seasoning in addition to red pepper flakes. Overall, this recipe was pretty easy to make and tasted good. Maybe it would have been a more flavorful if I had the fresh sage.,I enjoyed making this dish. I added spinach, and maybe next time I'll add mushrooms.
Quick to make, simple, wholesome and satisfying.
A hit in our household.
Thanks BA
PS. Daughter made your Tiramisu last night, it was amazing! So luxurious. It was perfect.,The idea of this recipe is good but execution needs some work (at least for me!). This was super oily...I skimmed 1/4 cup of oil from the top before I even baked it. In the oven, the sauce totally split and I had to return the entire thing to a dutch oven and add a lot of cream to save it. By then, I had gone so rogue in trying to make this dish edible that the intended flavors of the sage, sausage, and cheese really didn't come through. In the end, I felt like I had wasted 12 precious ounces of fontina cheese. I would make this again, but with a roux like in traditional mac and cheese dishes.,Have not made yet.  Can I bake this in a dutch oven instead? My skillet is only 8"" which I fear is too small...,Recipe was great and made plenty seconds and leftovers. Only issue I had was the sauce breaking. Mixing the half and half with the cheese in the skillet was tough and at too high of a heat. Next time I’ll likely bring the half and half up to heat in a separate pan and make the cheese sauce in there before adding to the sausage and oil mixture. Would definitely make again though. ,Can't get broccoli rabe where I'm at.  Any recommendations on a substitute?,Husband complained he shouldn't have eaten so much (3 helpings)... I'd say that's a win,Really tasty! There was a thick layer of orange grease when I attempted to make the sauce, so it never fully emulsified, and once it went into the oven, the sauce split. Didn't affect the taste really, but it does look kinda gross,Used romanesco instead of broccoli rabe and it was great!,This is one of my favorite things to make (and my boyfriends absolute favorite thing to eat). I forgo the crunchy sage on the top, but add about double what the recipe calls for for sage and red pepper flakes in the sauce. Bursting with flavor, so cheesy, and feeds the two of us for lunch and dinner for two days. 10/10 from us!,I've made this dish for many occasions and its a huge hit. Extremely flavorful and delicious when reheated. ,This was an amazing dish - my kids ate it  up!  Declared ""restaurant quality"" and as a mom just trying to make my kids happy...that means a lot! I changed two things.  First, several kids don't like italian sausage and so I substituted prosciutto which was thinly sliced and I just cut up and put in the recipe similarly.  I also used rigatoni - no big deal but kids like the tube pasta.  Thanks BA for a great recipe!,Made this tonight with campanelle pasta, half fontina half Tillamook sharp cheddar (props to Terrrra), and chopped half a white onion to go in with the garlic.  It's now on the permanent rotation; my wife says ""Make it again and don't change a thing!""

Was a little apprehensive about that big bunch of broccoli rabe and a pound of pasta all fitting in my Lodge 12-inch cast iron skillet but there was room to spare.  (And with a pot for boiling the pasta and greens, it's not really one-pot dish, now is it, BA?),I added a small diced onion to the sausage mixture & used both cheeses. Whenever I bake a pasta dish like this I always use a “meatier” pasta like Gemeli or Cavatelli because it remains denser (al dente) after baking, Most thinner pastas get too gummy after baking even if they are al dente to start with. Just my theory from past experiences, otherwise a very good dish! ,This dish is quite tasty. I made it as a surprise for my husband who loves all things pasta. Our grocery store didn’t have fontina cheese so I used Kerrygold aged cheddar. The store also didn’t have broccoli rabe so I used a couple of handfuls of mixed baby kale and spinach. I love how the sage leaves tossed in olive oil crisp up in the oven. My husband and I can eat a good bit and with this recipe, we actually had leftovers. It is very substantial and delicious. ,My boyfriend loves this I’ve made it several times now and it’s very easy and delicious. I have a hard time finding broccoli rabe so I substitute a few handfuls of kale and I’ve used spinach when in a pinch.,Good one. Really really good.  ,This is my new favorite baked mac and cheese. I would definitely recommend using both the Fontina and aged cheddar cheeses, because it gives the dish a bit of extra flavor. ,I made this last night and it was great! My grocery store didn't have broccoli rabe so I used dandelion greens instead (which they weirdly did have) and it was a great substitution. The only thing I would suggest is starting your pot of water about 15 minutes earlier than you start your sausage/cheese mixture - my mixture ended up sitting for a bit while the water finished heating up and the pasta cooked, and the consistency ended up not as smooth as it started.

Otherwise this was a great recipe!"

I sauteed some shredded cabbage in the pan after removing the chicken and served with kimchi. ,This is a very easy recipe and the final result is delicious.

Chicken took a little longer than anticipated to brown, probably because i used an electric burner, but it browned significantly in the oven as well. The skin stuck a bit to the pan on some of the pieces, but nothing too bad that a quick tug with tongs wouldn’t release. Used bone-in chicken thighs as well as legs. Very simple recipe, very hard to mess up and it comes out super flavorful, super rich. Pulled out before the veggies got time to caramelize because it became real saucy real quick- veggies didn’t really get a chance to get any color. I just pulled it out when the chicken was cooked through. Served with mashed potatoes, made for a very filling dinner! Would recommend.,This was delicious! I used the leftover fennel lemon roasted tomato and drippings the next day on ricotta toast with a poached egg and felt like genius. I would make this again and again.,This was excellent! Thanks so much for putting it out there. I doubled the lemon slices, and I didn't use the ""sauce"" I used my Le Creuset and the chicken release. I used extra olive oil for the browning and poured it out before I sauteed the shallots. Did the shallots first, until they were almost browning. Then added the lemon and fennel for just a couple minutes. A keeper!,I made this and thought it was fantastic.  The chicken was juicy, the skin was super crispy and the veggies and sauce were delicious.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend apparently hates fennel (he otherwise gave this a rave review).  Does anyone have a suggestion for a veggie I could substitute the next time I make this?,This was disappointing.  I followed the recipe to a T but my chicken stuck to my skillet and was cooked before it had browned or released from the pan. I wonder whether using an electric stove makes a difference?  It was also a bit greasy tasting and I felt the there could have been more flavour.  It lacked oomph.  Not sure whether I'll make it again. ,For those of you that have problems with the chicken sticking to the pan: I do use my All-Clad stainless pan for this recipe, and while I thought the chicken skin might stick to the pan, if you leave it alone, and don't try and move it around, the pan will release the chicken skin when the skin is crispy. It seriously worked for me, and I had the crispiest chicken skin I've ever had - and my guest agreed. I give a lot of credit to my All-Clad pans. I was really afraid of everything sticking, when I first got them, but the key is to leave the meat or fish alone (when cooking skin or fat-side down). It WILL  release!!!,In the words of Stefon: this recipe has everything. You get crispy chicken skin, nice acidity from the tomato and lemon, and subtle sweetness from shallot and fennel. Plus, it's pretty on the dinner table.,Terrific! One note: I would serve the fennel oil on the side to avoid lessening the crisp on the thighs. I NEVER put any sauce on fabulousness of crispy.,Chicken sticking to the pan....   We use a lot of the mail order prepared meals and you see this technique for browning chicken on a regular basis.  I fought through the ""sticking chicken"" problem and finally found something that worked for me.  If you aren't going to use a non stick pan, you will have to be generous (as they show...) with the olive oil.  All  my mail order recipes recommend doing this from a cold pan and putting the heat on medium-high.  This may seem a little hot, but it isn't.  Here is what I found.  After putting the chicken in the pan, move them around a bit while the pan is warming up and starting to cook.  Once it starts to firm up you don't have to do it as often.  I gave up trying to do this with a metal surface pan.  I'm a fan of these infomercial ""copper/diamond/etc. etc"" coated pans.  But even these will stick once they get seasoned.  Bottom line.. just keep the chicken moving and it won't have a chance to stick.  ,My ckicken skin also stuck to the pan. Is there something magical about All-Clad pans? I used a high quality stainless steel copper inset saute pan, followed the directions, and had to peel the skin off with a spatula. The combination of fennel and chicken was very good. The tomato slices did not cook much. So, so sum up, I liked the flavors, did not get the benefits of magic cold statt, and if I make it again, I will either use a little flour on the chicken skin or try a non-stick pan, even though they don't get the sear. ,Really good! Followed the recipe but used 4 chicken thighs instead of 6 (had a smaller pan and was only cooking for 2.) Didn't adjust any of the other ingredients and it turned out great. The chicken skin took a little longer than 10 minutes to get as brown as we wanted, but more time on the stove didn't seem to affect the final product in any way. ,Excellent.  All my guests made me print the recipe for them.  A major hit!  The juice from the tomatoes was outstanding.  ,I made this for dinner tonight, and it was so easy and tasty! Make sure you like citrus because the chicken and fennel really absorb the lemon. Also, this is a great dish if you’re looking to save money—the only “costly” ingredient was the chicken!,Just made this tonight! It was delicious, and I'll definitely make it again. The cold pan method worked great, and I had the perfect amount of oil to keep going with the veggies. This is an easy and delicious recipe for a weeknight dinner. ,I made this this evening  d partner and I both loved it.  Next time I will add grated garlic, maybe mushrooms and pepper strips, may e extra tomatoes for the fluid.  The cold pan method worked perfectly. Outstanding flavor!!! ,I will make this recipe again. However, the method of using a cold pan did NOT work for me, and this annoyed me, especially after all the fanfare and declarations of success. As usual, the chicken skin stuck to the pan and made an ugly mess. The thighs looked nothing like the photos. The taste was good, although fairly basic. I would add more flavor next time, perhaps with thyme, garlic, some white wine to deglaze, and maybe a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese."
Spicy Lamb and Lentils with Herbs,"1 tablespoon vegetable oil,½ pound ground lamb,Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper,2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced,1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes,½ teaspoon cumin seeds,1½ cups cooked brown or French green lentils (from 1 cup dried),½ English hothouse cucumber, chopped,½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus leaves for serving,¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, plus leaves for serving,¾ cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt,Flatbread and lemon wedges (for serving)","Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high.

One-Skillet Chicken with Buttery Orzo,"Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper,6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 pounds total), patted dry,3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided,1 fennel bulb, chopped, plus fronds, chopped,1 leek, white and pale green parts only, chopped,8 ounces orzo,⅓ cup dry white wine,2½ cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided,1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice,1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest","Preheat oven to 400°. Rain salt and then some pepper all over chicken. Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Nestle chicken, skin side down, in skillet in a single layer with no gaps (if you can’t quite fit them all, wait until chicken shrinks slightly, then puzzle in the remaining pieces). Cook until meat is opaque around the edges and skin is deep golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Turn chicken skin side up and transfer skillet to oven; bake, uncovered, until chicken is cooked through, 10–15 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.,Set same skillet over medium; combine fennel bulb and leek in skillet and sprinkle in some salt and pepper.

Pile chicken on top and finish with lemon zest.","cooking orzo as if it was risotto is a DREAM... just the orzo with whatever you want on top is an absolute winner! :) (i won't rate it because i just followed the orzo part, but i would give it 10/10),Hi BA & Brad Leone,
This is a stunning meal, I made a few tweaks just out of necessity, and I’ll definitely cook this again. 
Tweaks;
- swapped the orzo for par cooked lentils, freekeh & beans (soup mix)
- lightly charred some broccoli with the chicken just to get some super greens! Yeah super greens!
- used ghee instead of butter for the first stage 

My wife and I loved this dinner. Sending cheers from Rye, Victoria, Australia.

Pesty ,This recipe is a WINNER! So easy, so delicious, and hardly any clean up necessary. I have a feeling that I'll be making this again and again.,Amazing! Family favorite and so ridiculously easy!,How do you keep the chicken warm if there is still about 20 minutes of cooking after the chicken comes out of the oven?,this was amazing and so easy! very good for my tiny apartment kitchen,This one is a knockout! Great one pan meal. Cooking the orzo in the broth slowly gives this dish an amazing creaminess. One issue we found is it can be difficult to keep the chicken crispy, especially if you have to put it aside for 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 10/10 - have already made it again!,Believe it or not, the local Whole Foods was out of both fennel AND leeks . . . .subbed shallots and celery (under-rated, in my opinion), threw some oregano on top,  and this was DAMN GOOD.  Meant to pick up garlic per reviewers, but forgot, and didn't miss it.  Packed up as I""m moving, and it cooked fine in the remaining stainless steal pan .. . and honestly, am eating this all by myself and loving life right now.  

This is a great basic recipe with whatever onions and greens you have on hand.  ,The thighs were excellent with very crispy skin. However, the orzo is incredibly sticky and starchy. Great flavors, but not so much on texture. Next time I'll cook the orzo separately and stir it in at the end. 4 stars as is, probably 5 stars with the orzo revision.,Loved this recipe!! Followed the comments - using olive oil instead of butter for cooking the chicken skin-down in the pan (and using butter for the fennel/leek), reducing chicken stock to one cup, and adding garlic and onion. I also added fresh rosemary as well.

This dish was amazing. Used a cheap Charles Shaw sauv (not the driest) but this dish was fantastic. Super light on flavor combinations but savory at the same time.  Great healthy comfort meal. <3 Thank you BA.

Only concerns... I wish there was a measurement for the fennel and leek as I believe the veg I got were massive. I didn't use half of the leek or fennel and I had a ton in the pan. Also, my chicken needed a little bit more cooking than the allotted time but that was my fault.,Loved this recipe! I added garlic like others have suggested and it did seem to make the flavors come alive. The dish overall did come out a little oil heavy than I'd like so I may hold back some of the butter and/or chicken fat from the skillet. Also may try with chicken breast next time. But overall it was a hit and will definitely make again!,Solid recipe that I would for sure repeat.

Like I saw in the comments, I browned the chicken face down in olive oil before putting the cast iron in the oven, and then used butter for the fennel/leek mix (with 2 cloves minced garlic added) once I took the chicken out. I also used only 2 cups of chicken broth, and the orzo turned out fab and just dry enough. Added some chopped kale at the end as well because I had to use it up, and it was delish. Would definitely make again for a nice healthy comfort meal.,I love orzo and I frequently cook chicken thighs in a cast iron skillet, so I was looking forward to this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. The thighs and orzo came out perfectly, but the leeks and fennel didn't add anything to the dish but texture and the beauty of the fennel fronds, no flavor. I will make this again because I like the procedure, but will try adding onion and garlic as suggested by other reviewers.,This is my favorite go-to recipe when I don't feel like cooking - or even when I do.  Marvelously simple and delicious!  This was my introduction to orzo and I've used it in many dishes since.  ,This is a wonderful recipe, which I make often when in the USA.  While here in southern  France, I can't find orzo.  Can anyone recommend a pasta substitute that can be prepared in the same manner?  
,LOVE this recipe. I have made it a couple of times and it is delicious. I used a little less broth- otherwise, it took closer to 20 minutes to cook off all of the liquid in the orzo.  ,We loved the chicken, but I am not a fan of orzo. For next time, I'd like to sub rice. The timing seems right, but I'm stumped on how much more liquid to add. I don't want to turn this into a risotto exercise, but it seems that 's where the recipe is heading. Any advice?,Usually love the orzo and was looking forward to having this recipe. 
The flavor was not good at all. Way too strong lemon flavor and fennel/leak combination in here was not very successful. Would never make this one again ,This must be one of my all-time favorite recipes, ever! I've made it so many times that I can offer the following tips. 

- I have always been afraid of salt. Don't be afraid to use salt and really season your chicken. I also add Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning where the recipe calls for pepper. 
- I forgot to add butter when browning the chicken. last time I made it. But it was actually better when I just used a bit of olive oil to brown the chicken and then used the 2 tbsp of butter to sautée the veggies.
- Chop the veggies rough/large and don't overcook at the beginning - as they soften when you're cooking the orzo. 
- Just add the fennel fronds right at the end to add color. 

THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST RECIPES EVER - AND SO EASY TO COOK FOR GUESTS, OR JUST A NICE QUICK WEEK NIGHT DINNER. THANK YOU! ,This was excellent! The timing and ingredients worked almost perfectly. The only issue I had was I was not able to toast the orzo as much as the recipe indicated. It was sticking to the pan even though the pan was well seasoned. Other than that, it was pretty exact and delicious! I really would not change a thing. Oh, except for the fact that I only had boneless skin-on thighs. Still worked well. I just took the pan out of the oven after 10 minutes.,I finally made this recipe for the first time today, and I am pleased with the results! Next time, I'll take the advice of others here and add garlic cloves. The chicken thighs turned out more oily than I like, so I may switch to breasts on my next go-around.,This is a great recipe for midweek dinner or a bachelors meal for a few days. I followed the advice about using a half onion & 2 cloves of garlic. I reduced the broth down to 2 cups as well and used limes in place of lemons. This turned out fantastic. The flavors of the veggies blends so well together. There’s no licorice-y flavor and it’s not that labor intensive. I feel like this is a great mid-week dinner for 2 and  lunches for the next day. I used a can of $3 Trader Joe’s Pinot Grigio.,Could someone suggest a substitute for the fennel? I have an aversion to the idea of licorice, so I'm not trying to replicate the fennel, just substitute something that would also pair with the onion and be delicious. 
This recipe looks amazing in all its other attributes. ,This is an excellent recipe. We loved it, but it is a LOT of work with the constant stirring, and the stirring was essential to keep the orzo from sticking to the pan. Like others, I also added 1/2 and onion and a few cloves of garlic. Nest time, after removing the chicken, I will heat the skillet to evaporate the juices before adding the vegetables.  The juices made it take longer to brown them and harder to brown the orzo.,Awesome! I actually ended up using 3 cups of chicken stock.  Orzo took longer to cook than what recipe says.  It was a huge hit. A little labor intensive but worth it. I am willing to invest time in a 1 pot meal. I wish I could add a photo of how mine turned out. It was picture perfect.  Highly recommend this recipe."

The pre chopped pancetta I bought didn't produce enough fast but it still turned out great. ,I love this recipe so much! It was my first time making pasta carbonara and I panicked all the way through and it still turned out amazing. So any recipe that can still hold up after some panic mistakes is 10/10 for me.,This is good but the second best carbonara recipe. First is ciao chow’s recipe. This one lacks the full bodiless of  That recipe but still very good. ,I’m 18 years old and I’m at home with my family during this crazy quarantine (can I say the q word?) and I made this amazing pasta. It was a huge hit and my Italian family said it was the best carbonara they’ve ever had. My mom’s a New Yorker and my dads from Chicago and they’re Italian so they know good Italian food. I am so excited that they loved it! My mom made homemade pasta sauce that took 3 days to make and she said that this pasta tasted better, this is really a winner! Thanks Claire for the awesome recipe!!! ,Delicious, comforting, easy! 
I have always thought carbonara was labour intensive but boy was I wrong!
I love that this dish makes for a perfect weeknight meal but could just as easily impress dinner party guests! 
This should be in everyone's recipe rolodex!
Some changes we made: we used bacon as that is all that we had on hand given these crazy CODID-19 times, and added peas - yum!,Great recipe. Super easy to follow and a tasty result. ,Delicious! Added a heavy handful of crushed red pepper....will be making again very soon.,Loved it! I should have added more salt actually, I don’t think I salted the water enough,I cooked this exactly according to the instructions.  Came out perfect!
--Dave,Was so afraid of carbonara but this recipe makes it so easy. We do a half recipe with bacon on occasion for Sunday night dinner for my husband and myself. Yum!,I think it was pretty tasty. Easy enough to follow the recipe. My wife’s response “so that’s carbonara” ,Something about this tasted not quite right, I'm not sure what I did wrong. I'll try again tonight. The sauce was really smooth and creamy though :),This recipe was so easy to follow and tasted great too! 
As a student running from school to home, I was able to follow this fast enough, before I get hangry. 
I mixed in mushrooms and other veggies in, and it was just AMAZING. 
,Great quick weeknight meal! Added parsley for some color at the end- perfect!,This pasta saved my marriage. My husband and I, after trying many times to make pasta carb over the last few years & failing/fighting throughout the process, tried this tonight and it was a SUCCESS! We loved it! In response to others saying it was too salty: We didn't find it salty at all, maybe even not salty enough? We used Diamond Crystal kosher, which I know is not as strong as others, so maybe others were using v strong kosh salt. Anyways, we loved this and ended the night with""Great job babe!!"", instead of ""THROW IT OUT, I GUESS WE'RE ORDERING TACO BELL!"" love you forevs, bon appetit ,Help! Followed it step by step and I couldn’t end up eating it... once I added the egg mixture to the noodles I basically got scrambled eggs mixed into spaghetti. 2 whole eggs, 4 yolks, remove pot from heat and stir into noodles. Where did I go wrong?,The thought of making carbonara always intimidated me a little, but this recipe was super approachable and absolutely delicious! The sauce was absolutely perfect and seasoned just right. I'll definitely be making this again!,I made this recipe exactly, and it was sooooooo salty. Like, it was almost too salty to eat. Definitely don’t add as much salt as they recommend. Otherwise, it was delicious. The consistency of the sauce was amazing. This recipe is super easy; definitely give it a try. ,JESUS CHRIST, GUYS, DO NOT ADD ALL THAT SALT TO THE PASTA. What on earth?? I've made this recipe twice and I salted the water like I normally do, but it always came out not as salty as I wanted it to. So this time I followed the recipe by adding 3 tbsp to the 6 quarts of water as directed. What came out was the saltiest pasta I've ever had and it was too painful to eat. Add only 1.5 tbsp of salt and then even it out with some extra parmesan if you need to. Other than that, the consistency is perfect and the sauce is ideal. If you're adding bacon, reduce salt to 1 tbsp because this is insanely salty. ,Making this after a busy day at work, late getting home, while my son and the dog race around the house, through the kitchen, banging, laughing, phone screen blacking out, husband calling, dad calling, trying to remember what it is I am forgetting to do...followed the basic recipe, sort of (bacon, onion, gf pasta, pasta water, tap water, 2 eggs, 4 yolks, Romano, fresh ground black pepper, more cheese), and it was great. Thanks for the recipe in words and mini movies.,Creamy and rich and salty and satisfying, and still simple enough not to feel overwhelming in either preparation or consumption. Very pleased!,This was just super delicious. So luxurious and creamy! Some tips from when I made the dish: make sure you don't chop the guanciale too small and make sure you watch the heat so that it doesn't burn (the carryover heat kind of made mine a little close to burnt). Also: some people are saying this recipe is too salty, just make sure when you're pouring out the oil, you also pour out all of the seasoning that might have come on your guanciale. So good! Thanks Claire! ,delicious! Used thick slab bacon and it turned out great.  I really appreciated the videos- this is the best carbonara I've ever made! Helped me get the steps right so I didn't overcook the eggs. ,I enjoyed making it while watching the steps of how to videos. I tried it for the first time today. I do have to say my dish came out a bit dry and salty for my taste. 
Next time I will need to cut out the salt in the pasta water, I didn’t realize the  pancetta was salty I’m thinking of using thick bacon and set aside my pasta water and use it little by little as I do like my dish more saucy. Looking forward to try it again!"
Soy-Ginger Dinner Scramble,"3 small Persian cucumbers, very thinly sliced,Kosher salt,2 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar,1 tsp. honey,1 Tbsp. ghee or unsalted butter,4 large eggs,2 tsp. mirin (optional),1 tsp. finely grated peeled ginger,1 tsp. white or regular soy sauce,Steamed white rice, toasted sesame seeds, and sliced scallions (for serving)","Place cucumbers in a small bowl. Add several pinches of salt. Massage cucumbers with your hands, gently at first, then squeezing more firmly as they expel excess water and become more pliable. Pour off any liquid they release.,Stir vinegar and honey in another small bowl until honey is dissolved. Add to cucumbers and toss to coat. Season with salt if needed.,Melt ghee in a small skillet (preferably nonstick) over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, mirin (if using), ginger, and soy sauce in a medium bowl until eggs are completely smooth and no visible bits of whites remain. Add to skillet and cook, stirring with a rubber spatula, until large wavy curds form and no wet egg remains, about 2 minutes. Taste and season with salt.,Serve eggs on top of rice. Top with pickled cucumbers, sesame seeds, and scallions.,Do Ahead:, Cucumbers can be pickled 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.","LIFE-CHANGEINGLY GOOD,Sooooo good. I made these at 4am because I was hungry and couldn't go back to bed. If you ever wanna make something that SLAPS just right, these are your eggs.,Really good recipe. Pickles and eggs..hmmm. okay.  I am game. like the ginger, a bit of heat there. 
So now have another supper dish in the rotation. 
all is good. ,This so so good! Easy and delicious with a subtle complexity that makes it feel like you aren’t just eating eggs for dinner. This has made it into the lazy weeknight dinner rotation. ,This has become one of our favorite go-to lazy night dinners. Simple but satisfying and delicious. We add chilli crisp as a condiment and the textures are fantastic. ,Tasty and super simple. Next time I'll pickle the cucumbers ahead of time and add the mirin.,Unsure if I'll ever be able to eat regular scrambled eggs again. I had to sub sherry and a pinch of sugar for mirin as I didn't have any, but these were delicious. They're too simple and easy for you NOT to try them -- these eggs are game-changers.,This is just traditional Chinese fried rice. If you go to China and order fried rice, this is what you’ll get.,Great recipe! I made the cucumbers as well as the eggs and it actually is a great combination. Make sure you get the cucumbers super thin!!
The gee with the eggs is an amazingly buttery taste. Green onion really gives the eggs great flavor I added a few chili flakes as well. ,This is so tasty! I never would have dreamed that pickles and eggs would be so delicious and perfect together. Can’t wait to have this again!,loooved this recipe, perfect combo of flavors ,I only made the eggs but they were divine. I'll use white soy next time though.,This may seem like a simple recipe but -seriously- you guys, it's so so good. Ginger and soy sauce transform eggs, who knew? The sharpness of the pickles cuts the creaminess of the eggs and I dashed on some red pepper flakes for a little heat. Have already made three times and will make again!"
Tomato-Braised Rotisserie Chicken,"2 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil,4 oz. bacon (about 4 slices), sliced crosswise ¼"" thick,2 shallots, thinly sliced,⅓ cup dry white wine,2 garlic cloves, finely chopped,2 tsp. finely chopped rosemary,1 14.5-oz. can diced tomatoes,1 cup low-sodium chicken broth,½ tsp. kosher salt,¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes,1 2½-lb. rotisserie chicken, cut into 8 pieces,1 bunch curly kale, ribs and stems removed, leaves torn into bite-size pieces","Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or skillet with a lid over medium. Cook bacon, stirring occasionally, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are softened and bacon is brown and crisp, 8–10 minutes.,Increase heat to high and add wine, garlic, and rosemary to pot. Cook, stirring, until wine is reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes along with their juices, broth, salt, and red pepper flakes and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; nestle in chicken, skin side up. Top with kale, cover pot, and cook until kale is wilted, 5–7 minutes. Stir kale into sauce and continue to cook, uncovered, until chicken is warmed through, about 5 minutes more.","I was kinda disappointed by this recipe. The chicken ended up super soggy, and the tomato wasn't flavorful to me. Maybe I did wrong, but I don't think so.,This was awesome! Really easy and tasty. We used lacinto kale which I find not as tough to eat. So good!,Just made this except with a whole chicken butchered into pieces. It was SO GOOD and easy! I closed the lid on my Dutch oven and put it in the oven for 350F for 30-45 min. I ladled the broth over orzo and it was delicious and hearty without being heavy like beef stew. ,This is stupidly good and stupidly easy. I was pleasantly surprised how tasty this was. Great weekday meal! ,This one was one of the easiest and most delicious meals I've ever made! ,I modified this a bit and it was great. Broiled the chicken to crisp up the skin, put the kale in the sauce, chicken on top and didn't cover. Unfortunately, I didn't have bacon and it was still delicious. Chicken was nearly falling off the bones. Definitely will use bacon next time! ,My whole family loved this. Quick and delicious. Made the recipe exactly as is. The kale was delicious in the rich broth. I only left the chicken in long enough to heat it back up. Next time will serve with a loaf of crusty bread.,I had to modify this for my kale hating husband. I used a 10 ounce bag of baby spinach which I randomly tore. When I was grocery shopping for the ingredients (which were on the list I left at home) I thought there were also cherry tomatoes. So, having them, I added about 1 1/2 cups of halved cherry tomatoes along with the spinach. I agree with a previous review that the skin, especially on the breast was soggy but presented well and easily came off the meat. Would definitely make this again.,The tomatoes need to cook longer. The skin on chicken gets soggy. Any help with that? It didn't really enhance my rotisserie chicken, just cooked it way more."
One-Skillet Steak and Spring Veg with Spicy Mustard,"1 pound boneless New York strip steak, patted dry,Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper,5 garlic cloves, 1 grated, 4 thinly sliced,⅓ cup Dijon mustard,1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar,1 teaspoon honey,1–2 pinches cayenne pepper,⅓ cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil,1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, divided,1 10-ounce bag frozen peas,1 bunch asparagus, trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces","Season steak all over with salt and pepper.,Whisk 1 grated garlic clove, ⅓ cup mustard, 1 Tbsp. vinegar, 1 tsp. honey, a couple pinches of cayenne, ⅓ cup oil, and 1 Tbsp. water in a medium bowl to combine; season spicy mustard with salt and pepper.,Heat a dry medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Rub steak all over with 1 Tbsp. oil and cook, turning every 2 minutes or so and making sure to get color on the fat cap, until medium-rare (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will register 120°), about 10 minutes. Transfer steak to a plate to rest. Pour off oil from skillet, leaving crispy bits behind.,NEED HELP SEASONING THAT CAST-IRON? WE GOT YOU,Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in same skillet over low. Add 4 sliced garlic cloves and all but about 2 Tbsp. scallions (save those for serving) and cook, stirring often, until translucent and softened, about 3 minutes.,Add peas and a splash of water and cook, stirring and mashing to break up slightly, until peas are tender, about 5 minutes. Add asparagus; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until asparagus is just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.,PSA: FROZEN PEAS ARE JUST BETTER THAN FRESH,Slide 1 of 2,Previous,Next,Slice steak and shingle over vegetables in skillet.,Slide 1 of 2,Previous,Next,Drizzle some mustard sauce over steak and top with reserved scallions. Serve with remaining mustard sauce alongside.","This recipe is SO good. Even if nothing else worked out, I’d save this recipe for the mustard sauce alone. I’m not even usually into steak that much but the whole time we ate I was exclaiming how good it was. We substituted some ingredients based on what we had on hand- green beans for asparagus and white onion for scallions- and it still came out fantastic. We cooked it on the grill in a cast iron skillet. I’m already planning out what to make tomorrow with this sauce.,This is a really good meal.  I like my steak on the grill, but this is worth cooking in the winter.  Made a couple of changes.  Added ground chipotle to the mustard sauce, not as spicy but adds smokey flavor.  I did double the quantity!  Also, instead of honey I used a maple syrup that was aged in whiskey barrels.  Purchased from Whiskey Acres in Dekalb Illinois.  Figured it was a bold sauce and honey was too subtle.  I decided to go bold with the whiskey syrup.,Ate the whole steak in one sitting! Loved the vegetables too, even though I don't usually like peas. I will say, everytime I've made a basically recipe using mustard, the given quantity is too strong for my liking. Maybe its the mustard I use, but I'd cut back just a bit!,Delicious and easy! Someone else's idea to add mushrooms is a great suggestion for next time. ,What a simple and delicious dish!! Came together in a flash. The mustard sauce is easy to customize to taste. Want it a bit sweeter? Add more honey. A little thinner? Add more water. I liked it just the way it is written.,Amazing dinner for 2! Fast and easy,I've made this meal probably upwards of ten times (yeah that's way too much steak). My significant other looooooves it. He also loves green beans more than asparagus really so I substitute some green beans in without really changing the recipe and it works well. I always have a little mustard sauce left over but I save it for other things like grain bowls during the week. ,Super easy and delicious!  The veggies were a hit with the carnivores and vegetarians in my family, the mustard sauce was delicious on the steak as well as veggie patties.  It looked fabulous and tasted even better, with a minimal prep and kitchen time.  Next time I will add mushrooms to the veggies.  A big hit tonight!,I LOVE this recipe. Cooks in under a half hour but is really impressive. The kind of weeknight meal that makes you feel really accomplished. Also, the mustard sauce is amazing and great with other dishes -- fish, veg, etc.,I love this new layout and directions. Awesome job BA! <3 
,This was so easy to follow and tasted even better than expected. Love a recipe that packs in a variety of veggies. Beautiful!,Love this new recipe format! So easy to follow. Would definitely make this steak again.,Hey BA! This recipe article was so great to follow! I hope more recipes like this show up in my feed!,Loved how easy this was!,This was delicious.,This recipe seriously turned out so great! I will definitely be making it again. And I love how simple the steps were to follow with the images and videos. Mine didn't look as good as the pictures, but it certainly tasted good!"
15-Minute Chicken Paillards with Red Cabbage and Onion Slaw,"2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 8 ounces each),Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper,5 tablespoons olive oil, divided,½ small head of cabbage, very thinly sliced (about 4 cups),½ small red onion, very thinly sliced,½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes,2 tablespoons red wine vinegar","Pound chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to ¼"" thick; season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in large skillet over high. Carefully place 1 chicken breast in skillet (laying it away from you) and cook until golden brown and nearly cooked through, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until cooked through, about 1 minute (second side will not brown). Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with 1 Tbsp. oil and remaining cutlet. Let the cutlets rest while you make the slaw.,Toss cabbage, onion, and red pepper flakes in a medium bowl; season with salt. Drizzle in vinegar and remaining 3 Tbsp. oil and toss again.,Top cutlets with slaw.","I made this last night for dinner. My husband always gives me a hard time because I don't use enough fat when pan cooking meat. We have stainless steel pans. It worked great with the first batch, but I cooked more than the recipe recommended and the olive oil started to go brown so we added some stick butter to the pan. It was delicious! We also served it with a yogurt-garlic-dill sauce that we had leftover.,Just fudged this recipe, and it was still amazing.  Didn't have a mallet for the chicken, so I butterflied, and bought radicchio instead of red cabbage, but it still turned out great.  Great flavor and super quick and easy to throw together. "
"Rice with Parsley, Almonds, and Apricots","1 cup skin-on almonds,1 tablespoon olive oil,Kosher salt,1 cup basmati rice,1 3x1-inch strip lemon zest,⅓ cup chopped dried apricots,2 cups chopped parsley,1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice","Preheat oven to 300°.

Can I sub the lightly dried stuff or should I skip it altogether?,I am in love with this recipe! I have made it at least three times in the past few months. I was trying to find a way to use lentils and this recipe was absolutely perfect. It's simple but unique and packed with flavor. I usually use andouille sausage instead of kielbasa just bc I love andouille, but I'm sure kielbasa would be just as delicious.,I made a vegan version of this using 14oz of Beyond Meat brats and adding somewhere between 1/4 - 1/2tsp liquid smoke since the brats didn't have the smokiness of kielbasa. I also served with vegan sour cream (Forager brand is amazing). It was soooo delicious!!! A little spiciness, a little saltiness, a little umaminess. So damn gooooooood. Definitely will make again!,HOLY YUMS! I used homemade chicken stock instead of water & chorizo instead of keilbasa, but this was absolutely delicious. Took an hour in total & was dead easy! ,Let me tell you about this soup. I make this soup, like, once a week. It's a perfect soup. A little acid from the tomato and the yogurt, awesome herb-y-ness from the fennel and the basil, good body from the kielbasa and lentils. I go to bed at night thinking about this soup and I wake up in the morning thinking about this soup and in between, I eat this soup because it's all I make. It gets better with time as it sits in your fridge all week. It's a one-pot-wonder. It's sublime and it has captivated my waking AND sleeping hours and I just think you should give Molly Baz all the awards and definitely a raise because she has taken over my life with this recipe. Please make this soup. (I also use stock instead of water, but that this my only change.),Absolutely LOVE this recipe! Even better the days following! I'm not the biggest fan of basil (I know, shame on me), so I switch the basil out with spinach and it is great! I also double the sausage; can't have too much meat! ,Was good on the first night but even better the next day. Used fresh kielbasa because that was what I had but I imagine it would be good with almost any sausage. ,Really easy, tasty, feel-good fall soup. My tummy is happy 😊,such an easy recipe! i added mushrooms and used stock instead of water. turned out great, hearty and flavorful! ,Oh my god. I only made this because my boyfriend really likes lentils; I'm not usually a big fan. But one taste and I fell in love--absolutely will make this again.,Soooo good, so hearty and such a satisfying combination of flavors. I had a can of diced tomatoes lying around and threw it in at the end for kicks to add a little bit more acid and color, and that turned out nice. Garnishing with the young celery leaves makes it look so fancy!,So good!  I couldn’t find a fennel bulb in my grocery so I substituted roasted fennel seeds.  Added some cumin, butter, and extra red pepper flakes.  So delicious, will definitely make this again sometime.,This was delicious! Perfect for a chilly day. I swapped out kielbasa for smoked beef sausage but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Easily served 6 people as a main course will a serving+ left over. I was skeptical of just using water as the liquid, but the kielbasa, chili flakes, and fennel made the whole thing so, so delicious and flavorful. ,This was incredibly salty as-is. Probably due to a difference in saltiness for the sausage I used. Just a word to the wise to skip half of the salt throughout the process and wait until the end to adjust the seasoning.,We're vegetarian, but like to pretend we're not. I used Field Roast Chorizo instead of the keilbasa and followed the rest of the recipe as written, using brown lentils. SO GOOD. This is a keeper.,oops....forgot to add in my last post, that like another reviewer, I also added some green pepper and used chicken stock. ,I am almost finished making this lentil/kielbasa soup recipe.....am waiting to let the lentils fully soften before adding the basil and have tasted as I moved through the steps. I changed the ingredients slightly because I don't use much salt in general; chopped a jalapeno and added that with the onion mixture; and added about a tsp. of cumin for flavor. I am going to share it with a friend who likes spice, so I doubled up the red pepper flakes. It's now about time to add the basil which I imagine will add another dimension to the result. I will make this again. .,I loved this recipe.  I followed it without using homemade chicken stock for the liquid which I do a lot and it was still excellent.  I did put more a bit more tomato paste in it.  I found it really perfectly balanced somehow and that isn't something I've said before.  We all add a bit and subtract a bit to our tastes but this is an excellent recipe as written.  I loved the Kielbasa and actually wouldn't mind finding half again as many of those tasty disks in it the next time.  I gave it to two neighbors and one elevator man and they LOVED it.  I would never had dreamed of adding basil to this dish, but it worked out beautifully.  And I didn't mind that it got a bit stew-like.  If it bothers you just add water or
some white wine to loosen it up.. 
Definitely will make again.,The Mexican Cajun in me added some Louisiana smoked sausage and green bell peppers. Oh and I used chicken stock. I agree with one of the reviewers that it was too thick. Next time, I’ll add more liquid and tomatoes paste. However, this was such an easy recipe. ,I’m so sad, it was almost good! I followed the directions exactly but it definitely needed less onion (next time will only use one or two very small ones). There wasn’t enough broth, it came out mushy rather than soupy. I didn’t think it was enough tomato paste either, you could hardly tell it was there. ,I did not have kielbasa or fennel on hand, but I had everything else. I substituted some Trader Joes chicken sausage and added more celery. It probably would have tasted even better with fennel but I followed every other part of the recipe exactly and it was AMAZING. I never thought to add basil to my lentil recipes before. This will be going into my regular rotation of recipes!,This was very delicious! I would definitely make this again.
However, for my personal taste I made a few modifications. Given that the sausage itself is very fatty and releases a lot of fat, I found the 1/4 c of evoo excessive and drained a lot of it off. I think 1-2 tbsp would be enough. I also halved the amount of red pepper flakes and it was still very spicy for me. I think next time I would further reduce to 1/8 tsp. I also didn’t really find the the basil added that much to the soup for me. I think I’d opt for spinach next time.,no kielbasa, but i DO have tasso, Spanish spicy chorizo, ventreche, French garlic sausage, duck and Armagnac sausages, and bacon -- i think i can make do.  i'd add smoked paprika and sub sour cream for the yogurt.  in case you're wondering -- yeah, there's a cassoulet in my very near future ...,I just made this and it’s sooooo good! Something about the lentil and sausage  combo! Molly nails it again. "
Soy and Ginger Steamed Fish,"2 6–8-oz. skinless black bass fillets,Kosher salt,1 4x3"" piece dried kombu (optional),2 Tbsp. sake,2 Tbsp. soy sauce,1 Tbsp. mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine),¼ large or ½ medium head of Napa cabbage, stems thinly sliced crosswise, leaves torn if large (about 5 cups),4 oz. mixed mushrooms (such as shiitake, oyster, beech, and/or maitake), torn into pieces,1 2"" piece ginger, peeled, cut into thin matchsticks,1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil,2 scallions, thinly sliced,Cooked rice (for serving)","Slice fish into six pieces; season all over with salt.,Combine kombu (if using), sake, soy sauce, mirin, and ¾ cup water in a medium donabe or Dutch oven with lid. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Layer cabbage stems, then leaves in pot. Scatter mushrooms and ginger over, then place fish over mushrooms. Cover pot and steam until fish is opaque and just cooked through, 8–10 minutes.,Drizzle with sesame oil and top with scallions. Serve in shallow bowls with broth spooned over and rice alongside.","Such a simple recipe. It is also very humble and can be modified to suit your taste/what you have. I ad no access to cod but had some frozen pollock which worked nicely. Comes together really quick for a humble and warming meal! Love it Christina :),Ok, this is SUCH A GOOD RECIPE. I made this tonight, on a damp, blustery, frigid Canadian spring evening amid the godforsaken Covid-19 crisis and it was the perfect, delicate remedy my fiancé and I needed! I doubled the broth batch for an extra soupy turn out and used fresh cod along with Napa cabbage, broccolini and shiitake mushrooms. Took about 15 -17 minutes, as my fish was quite thick, but the end result was heavenly. We served it On white rice topped with scallions, toasted sesame and a bit of chili oil. Such a gentle, heartwarming, filling and incredible dish. 10/10 would recommend. Give me more recipes like this <3 ,This recipe needs help.  First kombu is technically seaweed but for anyone other than a dictionary it usually refers to a broth made with bonito flakes and “kombu” seaweed.  I highly recommend using kombu broth (BA has a good recipe).  Second, as described the fish is raw.  You either need more liquid or a higher heat.  Third this recipe as others have noted was quite bland.   If I ever made this again I would cook the cabbage and mushrooms separately in some kombu broth with sake and soy then drain the broth into a pan and cook the fish covered for a few minutes.     Then combine.  Enjoy. ,This is a fantastic and simple recipe. You must use Kombu (easy to find in a Japanese grocery) as that is what makes this taste like you are a pro chef. I used salmon and subbed spinach for the cabbage/mushrooms. Everyone ate it all up including my picky eater who said it was great after one bite. ,I love this recipe. I’ve made it three times and think it’s easy and fantastic. I’m not normally the sort of person who says they love a recipe and then doesn’t follow the recipe, but I’ve made a few minor changes with amazing improvement since the last time I most recently made it. I added acid to the broth, in the form of splash of rice wine vinegar, and I substituted dashi for water. The added acidity and fishiness really moved it over the top. Make this recipe, and listen to the other comments. ,This is my new weeknight go-to meal. I used wild caught Alaska salmon for the fish. I didn’t have mirin so I subbed 1 tsp of sake and 2tbsp of sugar.

The result was delicious. It took about 10 minutes of prep and then 10 minutes of steaming. The fish came out perfectly moist and the complimentary flavors were delicious. My husband spiced his up with Sambal and I used Shichimi Togarashi (Japanese 7 Spice) which added a delightful kick and crunch.

Will be adding this to our monthly rotation.,Delicious!!! Made it with salmon and loved it! We’ve already made it twice in 3 weeks,Can’t wait to make and eat this again. My kids loved it too. Easy, healthy, quick & delicious. ,Driving home, wife called “get fish”.  Nearest fresh fish was at HMart.  Googled bon app fish and found Christina’s excellent recipe. Got a fileted black bass and kept the head and bones for the broth.  Doubled the water in the broth.  Recipe was more Japan than Korea.  Used oyster, shimeji and maitake mushrooms. Took about 45 minutes to make a nice black bass nabe.  Wife loved it.,Anonymous -- I tried this with talipia last night and it was very good. It was even better for lunch today. As many have suggested, I added some fish sauce and juice of half a lime before serving. I skipped the kombu (couldn't find it in my store) and added extra mushrooms. I recommend it. Simple and tasty.,Would make again with changes. Needs heat and some acid. I would make again because fish was tender and flavorful and the cabbage was delishious, all of the flavors were clean but fell flat. Salting the fish is super important and next time I would add Thai chili’s or chili oil as others have mentioned. I would also finish with either some lemon or lime just to brighten it up a bit. ,The fastest, healthiest weeknight dinner I've ever made. And will continue to make, now that it's in my life. I can't wait to play around with different add-ons in the broth and different fish. Thank you, Chaey!! ,Why does it say to cut the fish into 6 pieces when the recipe serves 4?,Like the most recent reviewer before me, I added some fish sauce to the broth, chopped the ginger and added garlic, and the flavors were WONDERFUL!  With these small tweaks it's extremely flavorful and so easy and quick.  An elegant, simple and healthy weeknight additional.,I made this the first time exactly as written (except I used salmon, not black bass); it was fine, but bland. The second time I made the following changes: 1) dashi stock in place of the water 2) ~1 1/4 tbs soy and 3/4 tbs fish sauce in place of the 2 tbs soy 3) chopped ginger instead of matchsticks. 4) added some roasted garlic heads and chili oil. I can't stress how much better it was. All of the changes made a difference, but I think the addition of dashi and fish sauce are what really gave it more flavor.
And I echo all the comments here who mention how easy it is to prepare. It is a breeze.,Wow!  I actually felt like a chef after I made this.  It is like something you get in a really good Japanese restaurant.  I plan to invite guests next time and will use the line ""oh, it's nothing."",Made this for Saturday dinner because I needed something that comes together quickly and doesn't require a lot of prep. Everyone loved it, it's amazing. We love the flavors, it's super light but still filling. And there is absolutely no fat in the entire recipe. I used cod and all the varieties of listed mushrooms. Next time I will add more cabbage, it sort of melted away. Definitely will make this again. Also was the first time I used Kombu - says it's optional, but I do believe it adds to the flavor.,Sounds like the wonderful steamed Halibut they used to offer at Atlanta Fish Market.  They called it Hong Kong style and it was addictive. They added spinach at the last minute instead of the cabbage.,I don't get the cabbage part. Is the goal to have the cabbage be a base layer acting as a basket bottom for the fish to sit on?,Think I could do this with tilapia? ,This was so flavorful and simple!  I used arctic char because I couldn't find black bass and it was perfect. This steaming technique is truly a gamechanger for my weeknight meals. It's basically impossible to overcook steamed fish, plus the broth is so tasty. "
Pounded Flank Steak with Zucchini Salsa,"1½ pounds zucchini, cut into ¼-inch pieces (about 5 cups),½ cup red wine vinegar,1 tablespoon coarsely chopped oregano, plus leaves for serving,¼ cup olive oil, plus more for steak,Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper,1 1½-pound piece flank steak","Toss zucchini, vinegar, chopped oregano, and ¼ cup oil in a medium bowl to combine; season zucchini salsa with salt and pepper. Set aside.,Prepare a grill for high heat. Meanwhile, flatten your steak. Cover a cutting board with a long piece of plastic wrap and set steak on top; fold plastic over steak to cover. Using the smooth side of a meat mallet, pound steak to about ½"" thick. (Don’t hold back; you want it good and roughed up.) Pat steak dry with paper towels; season generously with salt and rub a bit of oil all over. Grill until browned, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare. (You might not get that much color on this steak because it’s so thin, but you don’t want it to be overcooked.) Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest 5–10 minutes. Cut in half lengthwise with the grain, then slice thinly against the grain.,Arrange steak on a platter and spoon half of reserved salsa along with some juices over steak. Top with oregano leaves. Serve remaining salsa alongside.,Do Ahead:, Zucchini salsa can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.",
Pantry Pasta,"2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling,8 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casings removed,½ medium red onion, finely chopped,¼ cup torn pitted olives, preferably Castelvetrano,1 14-ounce can cherry tomatoes,12 ounces spaghetti,Kosher salt,¼ cup peperoncini, thinly sliced,2 ounces Pecorino or Parmesan, finely grated, divided,2 tablespoons unsalted butter,½ cup torn basil","Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook sausage, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, browned, and crisp in places, 5–8 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl with a slotted spoon. Reduce heat to medium; add onion and olives to skillet. Cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, mashing tomatoes lightly and stirring often, until juices are slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.,Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 6 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.,Add pasta and ¾ cup pasta cooking liquid to sauce and cook, tossing, until pasta is al dente and sauce coats noodles. Mix in peperoncini, cooked sausage, and another ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid. Then, tossing constantly, gradually add all but ½ cup cheese, followed by butter. Once incorporated, remove from heat and mix in basil. Divide pasta among bowls. Drizzle with oil; top with remaining cheese.","So I didn’t stick to the recipe 100%, but that doesn’t change the fact that I loved it. I made it a tad more my style, by using spicy sausage, and Roma tomatoes because whole foods didn’t have cherry, and subbed spaghetti for bucatini. But it was definitely a very simple and rewarding meal. "
Chicken Piccata,"2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts,Kosher salt,½ cup all-purpose flour,3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided,4 garlic cloves, smashed,⅓ cup dry white wine,1 Tbsp. drained capers, coarsely chopped,4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces,2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice,Chopped parsley and lemon wedges (for serving)","Slice chicken breasts in half crosswise into 4 cutlets and lightly pound each piece between sheets of plastic wrap until an even thickness (about ½"" thick or less). Season lightly with salt. Place flour in a medium shallow bowl. Working one at a time, place cutlets in bowl and toss to coat in flour. Knock off excess flour and transfer to a plate.,Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan, cook cutlets, without moving them, until deeply browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook on the other side just until chicken is nearly cooked through, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a clean plate.,Add garlic and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to the skillet and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if needed to keep garlic from scorching, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add wine and capers and cook, swirling pan and scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of skillet, until liquid is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add ½ cup water, followed by the butter. Swirl pan vigorously while butter melts to help it form an emulsion with water, about 1 minute.,Return chicken to skillet and simmer until chicken is cooked through and sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir lemon juice into sauce; season with salt. Transfer chicken and sauce to a platter and top with parsley; serve with lemon wedges.","I've been loving many of BA's versions of classic dishes like this, but this one didn't do it for me. The water at the end diluted all the goodness gained from deglazing and wine. And in other versions of this recipe I've done, the lemon juice goes in with the wine (or stock) and is part of the reduction, and so you get a really intense beautiful lemon flavor without all the sharp edges of adding it at the end. Finally I like to cook the chicken all the way through in the first step - with chicken sliced so thin, it's really not much more time, and you get more fond for your sauce. ,Absolutely delicious. Dredged the chicken in corn starch instead of flour (someone had a gluten intolerance), and was still great. Will be making again!,Just made this for dinner for the fam tonight and it was a hit. Preparation to table was only a little more than half an hour. Definitely going to keep this in the rotation. It was so easy and very tasty. ,I made this for my mom for her birthday and she absolutely loved it! Posted about it on Facebook and everything!! The only issue I had was that I felt they turned out a little soggy, but I’m pretty sure that was just user error, as I am a very inexperienced cook. I’ll make sure to troubleshoot that next time I try this! Thanks for the awesome recipe!,Best plate I have ever tried (and cooked). Its just the perfect combination of tastes!! I went to the sky and returned in the first bite. God's food!! I agree with the coment above: I could drink this sauce every day for the rest of my life!!,Chris Morocco you've done it again! Seriously so delicious. Just be sure to give the pan plenty of time to cool off before adding the garlic. I waited 5 minutes but my garlic still burned a bit when I added the wine. Even so, it was still amazing and will definitely make again (and will make sure to serve with some crusty bread for that sauce!!). ,So easy, so yummy, tastes like childhood.,Made it and it's so good! Best chicken piccata I've ever made. I used a vegan butter cause I'm super lactose intolerant, and it was still amazing. The sauce thickened just like I had used butter. Also used green olives cause I dislike capers. ,I'm dying to know if this sauce can be frozen--the capers are what give me pause.  It's worth doing in larger batches and freezing for easy Piccata nights--defrost the sauce, dredge the chicken and saute, and voila, instant, fast, fantastic dinner. The sauce is simply amazing, and I cheated on it, too--didn't have a decent white so used Holland House (I know!) and REAL LEMON, too, not even actual lemons, and it was still fabulous. Can't wait to remake it with proper wine and fresh lemons.  Will absolutely put this version into rotation for the summer--and I'm going to  experiment with oversizing the sauce batches and freezing--it's that freaking good.  ,Everything was perfect: the sauce, the chicken, and the salty capers. And the easy-to-follow directions led it to be an under-30 min dinner!  This will definitely be a weeknight staple.,Amazing sauce!! 10/10 would recommend to anyone. We added some spinach fettuccine and it completed the meal! ,I love the recipe! You say, “Slice chicken breasts in half crosswise”
– I could use a little clarification in this and would appreciate guidance on techniques. ,Buttery lemon and so delicious! I added frozen peas when I return the chicken to the skillet and then served over toasted sourdough to soak up all the juices (plus one pan to wash up!)
Definitely a keeper!,I could straight up drink this sauce. Super quick and delicious dinner. Made some rice on the side to soak up all the garlic, lemon, caper goodness. "
Pork and Asparagus Stir-Fry,"3 tsp. peanut or vegetable oil, divided,2 lb. asparagus, trimmed, cut on a diagonal into 1""–2"" pieces,8 oz. ground pork,6 scallions, white and pale green parts only, finely chopped,5 garlic cloves, finely chopped,1 2"" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped,2 Tbsp. Shaoxing wine (Chinese rice wine) or medium-dry sherry,2 Tbsp. soy sauce,1 tsp. toasted sesame oil","Heat 1 tsp. peanut oil in a large skillet over high. Once pan is hot (oil will be lightly smoking), add half of asparagus and a couple pinches of salt and cook, tossing only once or twice so the pieces have a chance to blister, until crisp-tender and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer asparagus to a plate. Add 1 tsp. peanut oil to skillet (no need to wipe it out) and repeat process with remaining asparagus.,Reduce heat to medium-high; add remaining 1 tsp. peanut oil to skillet, then add pork, spreading out into an even layer. Season with a couple pinches of salt and cook, undisturbed, until meat begins to brown underneath, about 2 minutes. Break up meat with a wooden spoon and add scallions, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring, until pork is crisp and mixture is very fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add wine and soy sauce and return asparagus to skillet. Cook, turning to coat with pork mixture, until heated through, about 1 minute.,Transfer stir-fry to a platter or large shallow bowl and drizzle with sesame oil. Serve with rice and chili crisp.","This is beyond delicious and so easy to make! My honey was skeptical because it was “so green” but he is the one who finished off the dish.  ,Blistering the asparagus makes it so delicious. My husband is apprehensive about asparagus in general, but he kept  eating this served over rice as comfort food during this unprecedented time, including once at three in the morning for “breakfast.”,Delicious!  Added shitakes becuase we did not have much asparagus.  This would be good with any veggie that can be seared quickly.  ,Made the recipe as suggested and it was wonderful. Snap peas would also be great as others suggested.,Halved the recipe for a WFH lunch and it was bangin. Used ground beef instead of pork since that’s what I had on hand and served with rice. Will make again soon subbing in snap peas or other crispy veggies. ,I made this for dinner last night. I only had one pound of asparagus and that was okay. I was surprised how much my hubby and I liked the semi-crisp asparagus;I think it needs a bit more yummy sauce. I think the magazine should have included the link for chili crisp; I did not add anything similar. But this is definitely a keeper!,I made this for dinner last night, but didn't have chili crisp on hand so I subbed in some red pepper flakes. I loved this and will be adding this to my normal dinner rotation. I love an easy weeknight meal like this!,This is definitely going into our regular dinner rotation! So super delicious and easy to cut in half to serve just 2. I will say, however, you definitely don’t need quite so much cooking oil — none at all, in fact, when you start cooking the pork. ,Simple and very delicious! Not sure what a chili crisp is so I just added red pepper flakes for some heat.,Made as written but did not have chili crisp, subbed with Sriracha and served with left over pineapple fried rice.Good easy fast and liked not having to blanch asparagus,I know my fav. Chinese they just sear as well. Be good and stay safe.,Technique is good but the flavor is quite bland. Ended up making my own sauce for the leftovers and it's much better not. As is, bland but a decent base to add your own flavorings to. ,This was a simple dish to make. No complaints! I did add a little brown sugar to the sauce. ,Made this with green beans instead of asparagus since it’s what I had on hand and it was delicious served with rice! Reminiscent of Szechuan green beans... I agree with other commenters though that the chili oil is an important addition to really round it out - but I too used a store bought version... will be making again soon. ,I made this, but halved the quantities, because it's just me here and I only had 1 pound of asparagus. Came out great, but the chili crisp is *very* important. I had a bite without and it was fine, but really not that special; the chili crisp made it pop. (I was lazy so I used a jarred one that I really like from a Chinese market near me; I'm sure it would be even better with homemade.),This was outstanding. I bought far too much broccoli the other day so subbed that for the asparagus. This is going to be one of our new go-to recipes. Terrific. ,Yum, my teenager and I made this tonight it was a great cook together meal. We will definitely will again. Though I’d say it was more for two and one lunch not four. But then teenagers are black holes.  ,This is a great way of cooking aspargus so they stay tender-crisp but get some char on them. I'd recommend using a heavy skillet and cranking the heat as high as you can to mimic the effect of cooking in a wok. I used rice vinegar instead of the wine, and it did an okay job as a substitute. I do think it needs some sweetness, so I added a spoonful of honey to balance out the salt and acid.,This recipe is awesome. I had 8 ounces of ground turkey in freezer which I subbed in for the pork. And I only had 1 pound of asparagus so I subbed in some mushrooms that needed to get cooked. Otherwise followed the recipe. I think part of what makes the dish so delicious is in the blistering of the asparagus, which gives the dish a great char and in the browning of the meat which contributes to the texture. Great techniques. The other part is in the balance of the ginger/garlic/scallions and the soy sauce/Shaoxing wine which is perfect. The sesame oil finish just right. I didn't make the chili crisp so I used some hot chili oil instead. My partner opted for crushed chili flakes. Great Recipe. Thank you!!,Bomb receipe! I added white pepper on the pork and half a serrano. All on a small bed of stir fry noodles. I will definitely make this again. Thank you! "
Broiled Salmon with Scallions and Sesame,"2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced,3 tablespoons fresh lime juice,2 tablespoons soy sauce,2 teaspoons honey,1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil,½ teaspoon sesame seeds, plus more for serving,3 8-ounce skin-on center-cut salmon fillets,Kosher salt,1 bunch scallions,1 Fresno chile, thinly sliced","Whisk garlic, lime juice, soy sauce, honey, 1 Tbsp. oil, and ½ tsp. sesame seeds in a small bowl. Season salmon fillets with salt and place in a resealable plastic bag; add half of marinade. Seal bag, pressing out air, and let salmon sit 30 minutes. Reserve remaining marinade.,Preheat broiler. Toss scallions with remaining 2 tsp. oil on sizzle platter; broil until lightly charred, about 3 minutes. Remove salmon from marinade and set on top of scallions. Spoon some reserved marinade over and broil until salmon is charred around edges, about 6 minutes (watch closely to keep from burning). Spoon more marinade over; top with chile. Broil until salmon is charred and medium-rare at thickest part, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with more sesame seeds.","This is a great salmon recipe and have made it twice in a short period of time.,So easy and so delicious! Served with a side of left over quinoa and yesterdays sweet potatoes with cinnamon. Honestly the best weekday dinner I’ve been able to put together in minutes."
White Beans with Broccoli Rabe and Lemon,"3 tablespoons olive oil,1 small lemon, very thinly sliced, seeds removed,2 anchovy fillets packed in oil,4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced,½ bunch broccoli rabe, chopped,Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper,2 15-oz. cans cannellini (white kidney) beans, rinsed,¼ cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves,2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving,Crushed red pepper flakes (optional)","Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat. Add lemon, anchovies, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lemon is softened and brown in spots and anchovies fall apart, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli rabe; season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing occasionally, until bright green and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.,Add beans and ½ cup water to pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have melded and liquid is reduced by half (you still want it to be saucy), about 5 minutes. Mix in parsley and 2 Tbsp. Parmesan.,Transfer to a platter, sprinkle with red pepper flakes, if desired, and top with more Parmesan.","Very flavorful! Was a little bitter with the lemon peel. Will probably just add lemon juice at the end next time! ,So good! Love the lemons - great pop of brightness. Will definitely be making this regularly. I happened to have some barley on hand and I served the broccoli rabe on top. ,I agree the lemons and broccoli rabe together were overly bitter. All of the lemon peels in the food after annoyed me quite a lot, weird the recipe doesn't call to take them out as they are NOT edible.

I simmered the beans for 10+ minutes and still could not get the can bean taste out. May as well just eat the beans right out of the can...,We found the lemon + greens to overall be really bitter and there definitely should have been something sweet to balance this... it also ended up being a bit mushy and just not as appealing. Maybe we should have waited to add the greens and shortened the cook time... if that were the only issue, we would try again, but the bitterness makes this not a winner for us...,I used other white beans and it turned to mush so maybe my fault. ,10"" of cooking broccoli rabe made it over-cooked. Maybe wait to put the broccoli rabe in at last 6-7"" to maintain bright green, crisp-tender consistency. Otherwise, we enjoyed the ease of prep and it tasted great. "
Pasta al Limone,"1 lemon,12 oz. spaghetti or other long pasta,Kosher salt,¾ cup heavy cream,6 Tbsp. unsalted butter,3 oz. finely grated Parmesan (about ¾ cup),Freshly ground black pepper","Using a vegetable peeler, remove two 2""-long strips of lemon zest. Thinly slice each strip lengthwise into thin strands; set aside for serving. Finely grate remaining zest into a large pot (like a Dutch oven). Cut lemon in half and squeeze out enough juice to yield 2 Tbsp. into a small bowl; set aside.,Cook pasta in another large pot of boiling heavily salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (pasta will finish cooking in the sauce).,Meanwhile, add cream to pot with lemon zest and cook over medium heat, whisking often, until liquid is just beginning to simmer, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Whisk in butter 1 Tbsp. at a time until melted and sauce is creamy and emulsified. Remove from heat.,Just before pasta is al dente, scoop out 1½ cups pasta cooking liquid. Add ¾ cup pasta cooking liquid to cream sauce and return to medium heat. Using tongs, transfer spaghetti to pot with sauce (it’s okay if a little water comes along with it). Cook, tossing often and adding Parmesan little by little, until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, about 3 minutes. If sauce looks tight, add 1–2 Tbsp. pasta cooking liquid. (Cream sauces tighten up very quickly as they cool, so it’s better to lean on the saucier side of things.) Stir in reserved lemon juice; season with more salt, if needed.,Divide pasta among bowls. Season with pepper, then top with reserved lemon zest strips.,Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate Buckens","It IS better than cacio e pepe!!! This so crazy delicious. Made w/ half-and-half because I couldn't find heavy cream #covid19 and used tagliatelle. Loved. It.,Great recipe, so simple and tasty. Has become one of my favourite pasta recipes! ,Excellent recipe. I've searched for one similar to my favorite local Brooklyn Italian restaurant, and this is as close as I've found. I added more pasta water than the recipe called for so that I had enough to coat all the pasta liberally. Added lots of freshly grated Locatelli and a dash of red pepper flakes at the end. It was amazing.
,Love this recipe and have made it many times. Often I add veggies to it and it works really well with fresh summery veggies like zucchini. ,I drizzled the sauce over roasted cauliflower.  Delish.,Excellent but add sprinkle of finely chopped parsley before serving ,Amazing, new favourite recipe!! ,Absolutely delicious. For an avid lemon lover this was a must try, it was light and creamy and not heavy at all, just perfect. I added more lemon and some spinach to the pasta and some poached salmon on top, perfect combo. Thank you. Will definitely make again. ,Delicious! Light, fresh, isn’t weighed down by the cream or butter. Makes you feel very spring and happy! ,Swapped Coconut Cream for regular cream, still tasted amazing (:,By far one of the best pasta recipes I have ever made. Simple,delicious.  The only change i made was a bit more lemon juice a tspi or so, my family loves lemon and we topped each bowl with about 1/2 cup of crab meat at room temp. The pasta warmed the crab just right. Took an already decadent dish over the top. Would not change a thing. We had leftover so I saved about a cup of pasta water to try to reheat tomorrow,  hopefully the sauce won't break. ,Delicious pasta recipe, and so easy! I used bucatini, and needed extra pasta water to help the sauce stay saucey. Also added frozen sweet peas and chopped asparagus (quickly boiled in the leftover pasta water before adding), and lots of cracked pepper. I probably didn't season my pasta water with enough salt, so I also added more salt at the end. Yummmmmm!,One of the best dishes I have ever made. I was a little nervous about melting the butter with the cream, but it was so easy! Will DEFINITELY make again. Also used more lemon juice and pepper than what was suggested. ,Came out really well. Loved the fragrance of the lemon peel. We did use much more lemon juice than was suggested. ,Accidentally added the whole 1 and 1/2 cup of pasta water because I have no self control and forgot to only put half but I just put a lid on the pot and let it simmer and the sauce still thickened up very well. The flavor was amazing and I will definitely make again trying to add less water next time;),Brilliant recipe! Was a bit nervous around the butter sauce stage, but it turned out perfectly. I followed over reviewers advice and used the zest and juice of 2 lemons. For those in the UK I used 200ml pasta water, 500g spaghetti and double cream. ,This was delish. Made it while visiting my folks for the holiday,every member of my family — including my very particular father and equally particular 2 year old niece loved.  

I loved it too. I used extra pepper on mine.  So good.,Wow. 
I wasn't planning on leaving a review but that was until I reheated the leftovers. I've found that typically with a cream based sauce the leftover pasta comes out to be a bit grainy and dry, especially with pasta dishes like Fettuccine Alfredo. But this dish, I can't believe it. The pasta came out AS CREAMY as the first day I made it. How does that even happen?! Molly has done it again. Also the overall flavor of this recipe is simple and incredible. You get more of the lemon tang rather than the full citrus flavor which I love.I will continue to treat myself to this recipe till the day I die. ,Absolutely delicious, added some buttered chicken and it really blends in together.,This is :   alfredo sauce with spaghetti instead of linguine, pasta water and lemon added??  Caio and pepe with cream and lemon??  Its delicious, but a riff/combo of other often made delicious northern Italian dishes.  And, yes, I will make it again.,This recipe was so easy to make thanks to Molly. Such simple ingredients yet such rich flavor!!! Will definitely make again!!,So delicious and simple. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.,So delicious if you're a lemon lover! My family was blown away by it too. Super creamy. Easy to follow the recipe, i love Molly! Make sure to use tongs like she did so you don't break the pasta while stirring it.,Easy and delicious. Have made it three times and definitely will make it for the fourth, fifth and probably will never stop. Even my brother who is very picky with his pasta sauce this recipe!,It has an amazing flavor! One of the best pasta ever!  ...however I recommend to eat it in small portions. Since it has a lot of cream and cheese (which is obviously delicious) could be a little heavy to eat. Aside from that, it is the perfect pasta! 
* I also add much more lemon than the recipe said, because I'm a lemon lover. "
Sheet Pan Chicken Meatballs with Tomatoes and Chickpeas,"Mina6 tablespoons jarred harissa paste, such as ,1 large egg,½ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs),6 ounces feta in brine plus ¼ cup brine, cheese crumbled, divided,⅔ cup chopped parsley, divided,6 tablespoons olive oil, divided,3 garlic cloves, divided,1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more,Freshly ground black pepper,1 pound ground chicken,1 pint mixed cherry tomatoes, halved if large,1 15-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed, drained","Place a rack in top of oven; preheat to 400°. Taste your harissa. If it’s extremely spicy, cut quantities used in recipe in half (most kinds in the jar are fairly mild).,Using a fork, stir 1 egg, ½ cup panko, ¼ cup feta brine, half of crumbled feta, half of parsley, 4 Tbsp. harissa, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a large bowl until egg is blended and mixture looks homogenous.,Finely grate 2 garlic cloves into bowl, then add 1 tsp. salt and several cranks of black pepper. Be pretty generous here; 10 cranks wouldn’t be too much! Stir again with a fork.,Add chicken and work with clean hands until chicken is totally intermingled with panko mixture. Work it enough so that you don’t see big distinct pieces of meat, but then stop. Overworking could lead to crumbly meatballs. The mixture will feel very soft and wet and look a bit shiny.,EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO MAKE GROUND CHICKEN DELICIOUS.,Pour tomatoes and chickpeas into the center of a large rimmed baking sheet. Add 2 Tbsp. oil and remaining 2 Tbsp. harissa. Season with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Using clean hands or a small spatula, toss everything together right on sheet until chickpeas and tomatoes are evenly coated. Next you’re going to form the meatballs, but don’t wash your hands if you used them—the coating of oil will prevent them from sticking to your palms.,Roll chicken mixture gently and loosely between your palms into about 16 golf ball-sized balls (it’s okay if the balls aren’t perfectly round; just try to make them about the same size). Place on baking sheet, tucking them in and around chickpeas and tomatoes and spacing evenly apart.,Slide 1 of 2,Previous,Next,Bake meatballs on top rack until about halfway cooked through, 12–15 minutes. Remove from oven and take a look. The tomatoes should be starting to soften and burst, and the meatballs should look opaque and feel a bit springy to the touch. If not, bake a few minutes longer.,Meanwhile, combine remaining 3 oz. feta, ⅓ cup parsley, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl, then grate in remaining garlic clove. Toss with fork to distribute. Turn on broiler (to high if your broiler has settings).,Place baking sheet back on top rack if your broiler is on the top of your oven. If you have the kind that’s a drawer underneath the oven, slide ‘er right in. Broil meatballs, rotating tray once or twice if they’re browning unevenly, until browned and fully cooked through, some tomatoes are lightly charred, and some chickpeas are crisp, 8–10 minutes.,Let sit a few minutes, then sprinkle feta mixture over meatballs.,Do Ahead:, Meatballs can be formed on baking sheet 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and chill.","This recipe is delicious and easy.  It’s also flavourful and still healthy. Have added into the week night dinner recipe box. I used tomato paste and sambal olek instead of harissa.

The automatic video pop ups made following the recipe on a phone while cooking a nightmare, though.,I didn’t end up having feta brine so I ended up doing the salt and water combo as mentioned in the comments. Also couldn’t find harissa paste and used Siracha as a replacement. Needed to make this gluten free so I used chickpea crumbs (Panko). 5/5!,This recipe is a winner. The harrisa adds a unique and tangy flavor which pairs deliciously with the feta. Like other reviews mentioned, I didnt have feta brine so I used 1/4 cup water with 1 tsp. salt.  I couldn't find harrisa paste so I made my own with a few Tbs harrisa powder, a glug of olive oil, and a couple spoonfuls of tomato paste. Super easy dish that can be whipped up on a weeknight. ,This is one of my go-to recipes, especially when I'm having guests because it's easy to prep the meatballs in advance and then have them in the fridge until guests arrive. The little meatballs are flavor bombs. I made them for my mother in law and now she's making them all of the time. Writing this review as I'm prepping to make them again this weekend.,Love it! I used turkey meat instead of chicken. And the taste was awesome! Also I added asparagus to the tray so we can eat more veggies either the meatballs. I just adapted the recipe a little. Also I made my own harissa that was great and pretty easy. But I definitely will make it again!!!,These meatballs were delicious! I was a bit nervous using the broiler because there was a lot of splattering going on, but no fires were started thankfully. I do wish these recipes were designed to use up certain ingredients, especially those that might be unfamiliar. I have less than 2 tablespoons of harissa sitting in my fridge that I'm not sure what to do with, and I hate seeing food go to waste. Even just a suggestion of other dishes it could be used in would be helpful.,This recipe has become a weeknight staple for me! The feta brine in the meatballs keeps them wonderfully moist and tender. I had trouble finding harissa paste until I finally found it at Trader Joe's. Before then, I mixed 4TBS tomato paste with 1.5 TBS hot sauce / other chili paste, .5 TBS olive oil, and spices (cumin, coriander, smoked paprika) and it tasted wonderful.,These meatballs were delicious! Perfect amount of heat and acid. I've been dreaming of remaking them...,This was a great weeknight recipe even though I skipped the feta brine (I couldn't find any!). I subbed in some salty water...worked great! I used Mina mild harissa and thought it wasn't spicy enough (I didn't even notice the spice, actually). I will try the ""hot"" variety next time. ,I made without cheese and it turned out AMAZING! ,Can you make this dairy and gluten free? I love harissa!,has anyone done it without the cheese? really stoked to try it. ,Loved this! With Mina harissa, there was quite a kick. I like heat, but if I were preparing this for guests I might reduce the harissa a bit. Also, I could not justify paying $10 for 6 oz of feta in brine, so I bought 4 oz of the crumbled variety, and just added 1/4 cup water mixed with 1/2 Tbsp salt in place of the brine. I thought it was fine.,These were delicious! I used ground turkey instead of chicken--so tasty and the perfect texture. My husband and I both loved the spice. I'll definitely make them again.,What a wonderful surprise.  The flavor combination is fantastic.  Spicy but not over powering.  Very easy to make.  This will be a regular.,Very easy recipe - can be made the day ahead."
No-Fail Roast Chicken with Lemon and Garlic,"1 lemon,1 head of garlic,¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil,1 3½–4 lb. whole chicken,Kosher salt,Freshly ground black pepper","Arrange a rack in the center of your oven, and preheat to 425°. Cut ,1 lemon, in half crosswise and remove any visible seeds.,Cut ,1 head of garlic, in half crosswise. (If it falls apart a bit, don't sweat it.),Melt ,½ stick butter, in a small saucepan or microwave in a small bowl.,Place ,1 3–4-lb. whole chicken, on a cutting board (best to use a plastic one you can sterilize). A word on bird size. A 3–4-lb. chicken is pretty much the ideal size for roasting this way. Something a little bit bigger will work, but once you get much past 4½-lbs. it becomes harder to guarantee that the breast meat won't dry out in the time it takes the dark meat to cook. Pat the whole thing dry with paper towels. It's super important to get the chicken as dry as possible, which helps with browning.,With chicken breast facing up and legs pointing toward you, use a sharp knife to slice through loose area of skin connecting the leg and breast, making about a 3""-long incision. Continue cutting downward until you hit the joint that connects the thigh to the body, then stop (once you get through the skin, there’s not much there; if you are cutting through flesh, you’re too close to the breast). This exposes the leg joint, making it easy to tell if chicken is cooked. Repeat on second side.,Season every surface of chicken, including skin along backbone, inside cavity, under wings, and inside part of the leg you just exposed, with lots of ,salt, and ,pepper,. If you’re using kosher salt, it should take you 4–5 generous—as in, four finger—pinches, which will be around 4 whole teaspoons.,Transfer chicken breast side up to a large oven-safe skillet. Arrange lemon and garlic cut sides down in skillet around chicken.,Drizzle chicken all over with melted butter (mmmmmmm) and transfer to oven.,Roast until chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, checking for doneness after 45 minutes. To check, carefully remove skillet from oven (the handle is hot!), poke a knife into leg joints, and pierce the meat. If juices run clear, the chicken is done. If you see a rosy pink color, it needs more time. Continue to roast, checking every 5 minutes, until juices run clear. (If you’re not sure, you can also use the knife to lightly shred some of the meat along the thigh bone—the meat should look opaque and the fibers should separate easily.),Let chicken rest in skillet at ,least, 15 minutes before carving—this will help the juices in the meat to settle, and will also get it down to a temperature that is cool enough to handle with your bare hands while carving. Don't worry: It's a big piece of meat, so it will still be plenty warm by the time you serve it. Transfer chicken to a platter. Pour all of those glorious, buttery pan juices over top of the meat and serve with roasted lemon and garlic alongside. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!,NERVOUS ABOUT CARVING THE BIRD? THIS VIDEO SHOULD HELP.,Do Ahead:, Chicken can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool. Cover and chill; bring to room temperature before serving.","This recipe was such a hit at my house. I am typically not a fan of chicken breast, but the breast meat from this chicken was so tender and juicy, that I would eat it again in a heartbeat. The sauce at the bottom of the pan was so delicious that I eating the rest of it with just a spoon. The skin was nice and crispy. Just everything about this was perfection. I've been looking for the perfect roast chicken recipe for ages, and this one is it.,This was AWESOME and SUPER EASY! I've always been scared to cook a full chicken and I'm new to cooking. This was super simple to follow. I made the mistake of not putting it in the middle rack of the oven, so I realized halfway and corrected it which resulted in a longer cooking time. Still turned out juicy and full of flavor. This will always be in my go-to meals. ,This recipe is a ""Never Fail!"" The meat is always tender and juicy. I just popped it in the oven again:-),My BFF sent me this recipe and she just raves about it so, I made it last night and let me tell you... it is a new favorite keeper 👍 My hubby & I loved it and it’s so quick & easy to make! By far the best Roasted chicken I’ve ever made. I added rosemary. 
 Thank you ,This was fantastically easy to make - its a luxurious meal thats still incredibly budget friendly! 
We dry brined the chicken the night before to make the skin extra crispy.  ,This is my No. 1 go-to BA recipe. It's easy and super flavorful. I use 2 lemons and 2 heads of garlic though because I am usually cooking a chicken that is 4.5 - 5 lbs. It's the perfect recipe for meal-prep for the week as well. ,My wife and I made this recipe this evening and in a word - Wow!  This recipe is so simple and prior to cooking I asked my wife if she thought the chicken would have any flavor?  The chicken was full of flavor and this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Honestly, this is not your local supermarket roasted chicken!  Five stars!,I made this exactly as instructed and it turned out incredible! It was so ridiculously simple I was actually a little worried, but it was delicious and got rave reviews from my dining companion :) ,Omg! So simple and delicious.  I decided to use some rotisserie chicken seasoning.  One hour and it was the juiciest chicken I've ever made!,This is an absolutely incredible recipe and gets rave reviews every time. It's simple, yet powerfully delicious and so reliable. You can trust this recipe if you're a beginner or veteran, for a fancy dinner or just a relaxing Sunday. I've made it (three times!) before and it'll be my go-to chicken recipe until further notice. 

(Spoiler: Not happening. I'm sold!),Yes.  So much yes.  I had never made a whole chicken before, and yes.,This recipe is great! I happened to have limes around, so I used them instead of lemons. Juicy, browned, flavorful and quick. I will use this chicken recipe again and again going forward.,Can I use a roasting pan if I don't have a cast iron skillet on hand? ,FIVE STARS, perfect. I combined this with their air-salting method of prepping the bird first, letting it sit overnight in the fridge with a goodly sprinkling of salt and a light towel over it. I added more before roasting but probably shouldn't have (it's a tad salty right on the outer surface). But oh my stars, how this came out. I don't actually even like lemon flavors in my chicken, but I walked by faith here and did as instructed. It was perfect. Moister than I have ever had any roast chicken come out. I didn't think that the lemon and garlic would add that much, but it really did--it's subtle but richly flavored. The skin is amazing: crispy, crackling, rich, but easier to eat than the usual (for those who like it). And the gravy I made from the drippings was shockingly good too. Yep. I'm doing this every time from now on! Do this do this do this do this do this do this. Even if you're not a fiend for lemon chicken, use the lemon. Do as it says. This is foolproof. ,Ok OMG!!! This is ssssoooo good I am not kidding you!!! The only thing I added was a little rosemary. I could not keep my husbands fingers from snatching pieces before dinner was set.  I am going to make this  my go too recipe. I will NEVER bake chicken any other way NEVER again. (Pinky swear LOL) But do your whole family a favor and make this chicken. I promise you That you will not have any trouble getting them to put their cell phones away. ,This chicken is impossibly delicious and was my first experience cooking a whole bird. As a beginner chef, this recipe is very approachable and concise. I cannot stress how delicious the crispy skin was when the bird was done! Since it's been nearly impossible to find a bird smaller than 4.5 lbs, cooking time has gone up to at least an hour. 

I would make this recipe for every meal and every event if I could. In case you're mulling it over, let me make this easy for you: Make. This. Chicken. ,I made this on a Friday night when I was drinking, thinking I’d have leftovers for the weekend. A friend and I immediately ate the whole thing right out of the cast iron. Make this chicken. ,Out of this world delicious!  Then used drippings and bones to make stock, and that was the best I've ever had. Wonderful!!,THIS IS EVERYTHING 
,I've been making roast chickens for years and all other recipes have gone out the window for this one. It is my new Sunday night ritual. ,A no-brainer go-to for successful hosting, perfect any time of year -- just serve with seasonal vegetables.,SO good and  SO easy! The only thing I changed was to use whole, unpeeled garlic cloves instead of cutting the bulb in half. 
I would serve this to company.
,I made this recipe exactly as instructed, put it in the oven, came back 50 minutes later to a perfect and delicious roast chicken. I tossed some wedged red potatoes with olive oil and salt and put them in the oven while the chicken rested. 15 minutes later the potatoes were done, the chicken fantastic, a chopped salad had been made, wine poured—a great meal. I’ll make this again and again. ,Amazing! Turned out perfectly and the pan juices were so amazingly flavourful because butter. ,This is an incredible recipe-I make it weekly now for my family the lemon and garlic make a pan sauce/gravy that is super delish.  I love this one  so easy too."

The basmati rice was delectable (1 cup was perfect for us). The dish is well balanced, both in flavor and consistency, and not difficult to prepare. It was a big hit at my house. Thanks for a great recipe. ,I was wary of this dish, because even though it was highly rated, it seemed like everyone was tweaking it, always a red flag for me. I made it just as it was written. I agree with the reviewer who questioned basmati rice, it is too dry of a rice. Yet, even though I poured off most of the oil after browning, the rice was very greasy. It also lacked flavor, which surprised me with the shallots ginger and garlic. The peanut sauce was good, but I didn’t like it paired with this dish. The cucumbers should have been marinated, as someone else noted. To me, it needed so much tweaking that I won’t bother. ,This was delicious! I misread the recipe and my thighs did bit have skin on but this still turned out absolutely DELICIOUS.
Perfect amount of spice, I adore the rice, and the chicken just fell off the bone. 

I am so glad I made this. Thank you!! ,So I made this with boneless/skinless chicken breasts, cut into cubes and it turned out really well. The peanut sauce is delicious, too! I found the amount of water to be perfect and the resulting meal was fantastic. A really great recipe!! Thank you, Molly!,I made this before I read the comments. I need to start making a practice of reading the comments because they were very helpful. This recipe as is, could get maybe 2-3 stars. Due to COVID-19, some of the ingredients had to be subbed. Mainly, I only had boneless, skinless chicken thighs and no basmati rice, I used jasmine. 1. Rice. So much rice. 1-1.5 cups should be sufficient. Also, the rice lacked flavor, however the sauce made up for that. I'd add coconut milk next time and a touch more salt. Additionally, my rice took much longer to cook and I had to add extra water, that may be because it's a different type of rice, but the cooking directions are the same. Not sure what the issue was there.  2. The chicken. If I have the time, I'd marinate the chicken. Likely in soy sauce, fish sauce, coconut milk and maybe throw in some garlic, whatever I have on hand. However, this is not a must, it can still be great without a marinade. 3. The sauce. Good on it's own, but great when I added lime juice, fish sauce and sesame oil to my sauce. Though one can really add any combo and still get a good result. Overall a great flavors and a fairly easy recipe. ,This recipe is delicious and the flavors work really well together! The peanut sauce pulled the whole dish together and is a must-have in this recipe. I did add a little bit of oil in the pot when cooking the chicken because I was worried about it sticking to the bottom and I think that helped. Overall this dish was amazing!,I read the reviews here before making this, so I made a few modifications to the recipe by adding a lot more seasoning to the rice. I used coconut milk as part of the cooking liquid and it added a lot of dimension to the dish. I also pre-soaked the rice and par-cooked the chicken so that it all came together much more quickly. The peanut sauce is the MVP of this dish, DO NOT skip it. I will keep making that sauce to put on everything for years to come. Overall a really delicious fragrant meal and perfect for meal prep as well. Give it a shot!,The best rice I have ever tasted! Love everything about this dish. I didn’t use basmati rice and it was still incredible! Will try with basmati next time ,This was really tasty!  Easy to do on a weeknight too, and relatively hands-off . the sauce is possibly the best part, and also could be used for so many other things
,It was delicious and very easy to make. Even though i reduced the amount of rice and water according to how i usually cook my basmati and it was a very good amount for the amount of chicken there was. The peanut butter sauce was simply to die for. Would make it again!,Made this recipe with the following edits based on reviews. Made a soy, ginger, garlic, chilli and fish sauce marinade for the chicken first and marinated in the fridge for approx 4 hours. Then I cooked the rice in chicken stock rather than water and did the measurement based on sight than cups.

Came out soooo good! ,So I wanted to try this recipe, but I was missing a dutch oven, star anise, basmati rice, and vinegar lol. Because of the social distancing order, I decided against going to the store for these items so I used some lemon juice to replace the vinegar, jasmine rice in place of the basmati rice, and used a regular saute pan instead of the dutch oven. Despite all of these replacements, it still came out really delicious. The only thing I would mention is that there was a large rice to chicken ratio.,This recipe tasted great but didn’t really go as planned. The chicken stuck to the pan even after I browned it for nearly 20 minutes, and the rice cooked unevenly. Nonetheless, it was a big hit in my house. I’ll try again soon, probably with a smaller Dutch oven. ,I loved this dish. It was simple to make and satisfying to eat. I used brown rice instead of basmati and will bump the amount of water down next time to accommodate for that adjustment. ,This is definitely reminiscent of Hainanese Chicken Rice. I found that 3 cups of water was way too much, my rice was a bit mushy, but the flavour was wonderful! Ended up having to season the rice to bring out the flavour and I also added a little lime juice to brighten it up. I highly recommend making a green onion and ginger sauce (finely chop both and cover with hot oil then season with salt) as would go with traditional Hainanese Chicken.,This whole recipe is great. I've made several times on a whim and it's flavorful, relatively easy and fresh. However - the rice the recipe produces is NEXT LEVEL. You'll find me reproducing JUST the rice to go with anything and everything!,Despite the flavorful aromatics present in the ingredient list, this recipe came out extremely bland. The flavors were lost in the massive, I mean massive, amount of rice this recipe yields. The cooking times provided for the chicken and the rice were both way off. The peanut sauce was good so we were able to save the day by using a ton of it to offset the lack of flavor. ,Great recipe! Intensively savory, and anyone giving it a low rating because the chicken skin softens during the braise is *missing the point*! The recipe says it's inspired by Hainanese chicken rice, which has silky smooth, soft skin. This skin is nice and soft, with a nice toasty flavor from the browning. Great recipe, wonderful for weeknights and batch meals.,WOW! You did not disappoint. Loved this recipe. Made a few adjustments as I only had chicken drumsticks and Jasmine rice but it was still tasty. The rice was so fragrant and the chicken was very silky in texture. I also added a bit of lime juice to the sauce to make it a bit more zingy! I don't understand why others have said that this dish is bland and blamed it on the recipe. Maybe add some more salt? Recipes are a guideline and if you taste and adjust as you're cooking you'll be rewarded. Also this is a riff on Hainan Chicken and so don't expect the chicken to be crispy. The chicken is usually poached so browning it in this recipe you're rendering out the fat to produce more flavour. This recipe will definitely make it into our rotation. Thank you BA! X ,This recipe is soooo good! It brought me back to the chicken rice dishes that I ate when I was in Singapore. It was also very easy to make. Since I was only cooking this dish for me and my husband, I cut the recipe in half which was the perfect portion to feed 2 people.
I didn't run into any cooking errors when making this dish. If you follow the instructions step-by-step, you should be just fine. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the rice was fully cooked as well. The rice had a great, subtle flavor to it with the garlic, shallots, and ginger! And the peanut sauce was delicious! We like spicy food so we will probably add some chili peppers next time. Overall LOVED this dish and how easy it was to make! Highly recommended!
Slight Modifications: We used chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs, and coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. Turned out very tasty!,This recipe turned out delicious with some major modifications as follows: 1) The description says it's a quicker version of Hainanese chicken rice, which is Chinese, so making it with basmati rice, which is typical in Indian food, is just weird. I swapped it out for jasmine rice instead. -1 star for this 2) Following other reviewers' suggestions, I marinated the chicken first in the minced garlic and ginger with a healthy splash of fish sauce. I then scraped off as much as I could before searing, and then used used the marinade when toasting the rice before adding in the water. I like my dishes spicy, so I also tossed in some dried whole chilli peppers in. Even with marinating, it still could have had a deeper flavor so I can't really imagine it as the recipe says with no marinating, -0.5 stars 3) Definitely put the whole dutch oven in a 200C oven instead of cooking stove top which will cause uneven rice cooking -0.5 stars; was perfect in about 35 minutes. 4) Drizzle sesame oil on top of the chicken and rice before putting in the oven. 5) Also add a glug of sesame oil to the peanut sauce. Nixed the honey in the sauce since peanut butter is sweet enough as is. Use crunchy peanut butter for nice texture alongside grated ginger in the sauce. 6) As suggested by other reviewers below, quick pickle the cucumbers and add carrots in as well. ,INCREDIBLE. I was blown away - this dish was amazing. Easy to prepare and so full of flavor. We will be making this again.,Husband made this, it was delish. Would definitely make again. ,My entire family LOVED this recipe! I made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, just because we prefer breasts to thighs. The peanut sauce is amazing, the cold cucumbers were an astonishingly good contrast to the hot chicken/rice. I also added raw julienned carrots. We are adding this to our rotation!,The rice cooks too much if we abide by the 25 minutes. The spices are not enough, the chicken needs to be marinated, on the whole the recipe needs an overhaul and not worth to repeat it "
