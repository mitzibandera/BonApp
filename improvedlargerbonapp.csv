The dough did double in size, but it was so wet I could not knead it. I probably added at least one cup of additional flour, trying to get it to come together, but it just didn't happen. I live in Northern Arizona, so I'm slightly at a higher altitude with zero percent humidity. I'm just wondering what I did wrong ... two cups of water vs only four cups of flour just doesn't seem right to me. I've been to Parachute, love their bing bread, and want to make this recipe work.

I added that into the broccoli mixture. Then made fried rice with soy sauce and garlic, then one egg yolk. Added everything together and squeezed a little more lemon and voila AMAZING. try my recipe for anyone who thinks it’s too “simple” or “plain” :),This is a very strange recipe, and I found the directions to be a little vague. Based on the end result which was kind of meh, I don't know why the broccoli needed to be cooked two different ways. It has potential to be much simpler, and more delicious. It's just very weird!!,While the yeast, peanuts, and rice vinegar work nicely together, I would not recommend the dry fry method for the broccoli. After 10 minutes in the cast iron, I found the broccoli too crunchy for my liking and transferred it to a sheet pan with oil. The stems, however, came out perfectly. ,This recipe rocked my socks off.  I love the charred broccoli delivered with the nuance of surprise ingredients like sugar and nutritional yeast. I also really appreciate the provided nutritional content. This recipe is getting added to my regular rotation.,Not the most memorable recipe, but delicious and very week-night accessible.
