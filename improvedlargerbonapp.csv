Since I’m from New Mexico I added some red chili,This has to be said with a Boston accent...
This recipe is a keepa..
I added the juice of half a lemon
I did not use sage as I did not have any.
I used about 4 leaves of fresh basil
Easy and yummy and who needs to consider calories
,Delicious - we added chopped asparagus and added them in the step with peas, cut the recipe in half for two - perfect portions.  Good quality cheese is important, and lots of black pepper was a needed addition.,This recipe was soooo easy and sooo good. Re-reading it now, I realize that I forgot to slice the Proscuitto and just tore it into pieces and threw it into the butter...oh, well. Still great. This pasta is flavorful, comforting, and has a vegetable in it so it's healthy, right?,My wife and I found this recipe to be very disappointing and bland. After dinner, my wife made a separate cream sauce for the leftovers:). I would not recommend it..,This came out sooo good!! I halved the recipe but kept 16 sage leaves. YUM! ,This was delicious! ,So good! I didn't have enough prosciutto on hand and had to use some bacon as well, which made it extra fatty, but it was still crazy delicious. I even foraged for the sage, because I'm on lock down and I. Will. Survive. I made fresh pasta which bright it to an 11. ,Amazing!!!"
Rigatoni With Fennel and Anchovies,"3 large fennel bulbs (about 2½ lb.),½ cup extra-virgin olive oil,6 oil-packed anchovy fillets,6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced,½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes,½ cup (packed) mint leaves, plus more torn for serving,1 orange or tangerine,1 lemon,1 lb. rigatoni,3 oz. Pecorino Romano, finely  grated (about 1½ cups)","Remove tough outer layers and fronds from fennel bulbs and discard. Working one at a time, cut bulbs lengthwise (through root ends) into quarters, remove cores, and slice quarters lengthwise into ½""-thick wedges.,Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over high until shimmering. Add fennel to pot, arranging in as even a layer as possible. Season with salt and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown underneath and starting to soften, 6–8 minutes. Using tongs, turn fennel over and cook until golden brown on the other side, 6–8 minutes.,Reduce heat to low and add anchovies, garlic, red pepper flakes, and ½ cup mint to pot. Cook, stirring often, until anchovies are disintegrated and garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat and finely grate zest of orange and lemon directly into hot oil; stir well to evenly distribute. Cover pot to keep sauce warm and let sit until pasta is done.,Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain pasta, reserving 1½ cups pasta cooking liquid.,Uncover sauce, add pasta and 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid, and set over medium-low heat. Add Pecorino and cook, tossing vigorously and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until sauce is emulsified and pasta is coated, about 2 minutes.,Divide pasta among bowls and top with torn mint.","I was skeptical but the reviews were so good I decided to try it. I really like it - the caramelized fennel, anchovies, and pecorino all work together to create a really delightful funk. I think the lemon, orange and mint work well too - but next time I make this, I would sub out basil for the mint, just to come slightly back to a more familiar pasta profile. I could also use more anchovies. I have a really wide pot with deep sides which was perfect for cooking the fennel. If you use a traditional dutch oven, I can't imagine doing this in fewer than 2 batches for that first step. ,I’m still eating this and had to pause to write a review. This is insanely delicious. I really wanted to try it because it’s all ingredients I love but would never, ever naturally put together. You know what, it totally bloody works. It’s delicious.

I made it mostly as written, although I did increase the garlic and anchovies a little per other suggestions. Next time I’d add a tiny bit more even! And be sure to season really well. Also, I accidentally used parmesan instead of pecorino, which would have been even better. Either way, insanely good! I had to do the fennel in two batches even though I have an enormous cast iron. No sweat though - still easy as pie. Looks like a crazy amount of fennel to begin with I almost halved it but trust the recipe, it cooks down. ,Have to admit, I was a little unsure of the combination of flavors when reading this recipe, but I trusted in BA and am glad I did. Turned out surprisingly delicious! I made a half recipe of it, everything as written except that I threw in a few extra anchovies, because why not ;) I found that this dish really needed a fresh, zippy salad to go on the side to balance out the deep savoriness of the pasta.,This recipe is a keeper as written!  So dang good!,This pasta was incredible! I made it as written and absolutely loved it. With dried pasta being such a precious resource right now, I am happy it was such a winner! I'll definitely be making this for a dinner party when it is safe to do so.,This is really amazing- I followed the recipe to the tee and it was one of the best pastas I've had.  The fennel didn't fit into a single layer but after turning and a total of 16 minutes- they all browned nicely.  I probably put in more mint than called for- I might brave the grocery store for more fennel to make this again! ,Um WOW.  So this was insanely good.  I did not read carefully before I went shopping so I only had one fennel bulb.  I added an onion (just cooking for 2 anyways) and it was great.  I followed the tips of previous commenters and upped the anchovies and then added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end and dropped the mint.  Delish.,I only had 2 fennel bulbs but this fit perfectly in my Dutch oven. I'm not usually a fan of mint in pasta but the anchovies really mellowed out the flavor. I used a little more garlic and anchovies than the recipie called for. Definitely use pecorino for the brighter flavor and  use a large lemon for the zest.  My husband loved this one.,Didn't love this one. The orange and the mint didn't jive with the rest of the flavours, and it is difficult to fit 2.5 lbs of fennel into a large Dutch oven and get things to caramlize properly. Needs some acid (squeeze of lemon juice, splash of vinegar) to brighten things up."
Fusilli With Battuto di Erbe,"1¼ cups extra-virgin olive oil, divided,1 garlic clove, smashed,1 oz. mixed hardy herb leaves (such as rosemary, sage, thyme, and/or marjoram; about 1 heaping cup),1 tsp. fennel pollen (optional),7 oz. tender spring greens (such as arugula, dandelion, and/or broccoli rabe leaves; about 5 cups),5 oz. mixed tender herb leaves (suchas mint, basil, lovage, celery leaves, and/or parsley; about 6 cups),½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more,1 lb. fusilli (spiral-shaped pasta)","Heat ¾ cup oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium until shimmering. Add garlic, hardy herbs, fennel pollen (if using), and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until oil around garlic starts to sizzle slightly and garlic begins to turn golden brown, about 2 minutes (be careful when you add the garlic as the oil may spatter). Add spring greens and tender herbs and season with a couple pinches of salt. Cook, stirring often, until greens and herbs are wilted and bright green, about 2 minutes. Scrape herb mixture onto a rimmed baking sheet; spread out and let cool slightly. Reserve pot.,Transfer herb mixture to a blender or food processor and add ½ tsp. salt and remaining ½ cup oil; blend on high speed until you have a coarse purée. Taste pesto and season with more salt if needed.,Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.,Scrape pesto back into reserved pot and add pasta and ¾ cup pasta cooking liquid. Set over medium-low heat and cook, tossing vigorously and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until warmed through and pasta is coated (do not let pesto come to a boil), about 1 minute. Taste and season with more salt if needed.,Divide pasta among bowls. Using a mandoline or vegetable peeler, shave cheese over pasta.,Pesto can be made 1 day ahead.

Bucatini Alla Griccia With Fava Beans,"1 Tbsp. black peppercorns,8 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl),1¾ cups fresh fava beans (from about 	1¾ lb. pods) or frozen fava beans,1 lb. bucatini,2 oz. Pecorino Romano, finely grated (about 1 cup), plus more for serving","Place peppercorns in a bag, close, and coarsely crush with a rolling pin or heavy skillet (alternatively, you can crush them directly on a cutting board set inside a large rimmed baking sheet). Slice guanciale into ¼""-thick slabs, then slice slabs crosswise into ¼""-thick matchsticks.,If using fresh fava beans, cook in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender (the best way to gauge doneness is to check one; be sure to slip it from its skin before tasting!), about 3 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water; let cool. Drain and peel away outer skin from each bean; discard skins. Reserve pot with boiling water for cooking pasta.,Place guanciale in a dry large Dutch oven or other heavy pot and set over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Add crushed peppercorns and stir once to combine. Add 1 cup hot tap water (using pasta cooking liquid here could make the dish too salty) and bring to a boil. Remove pot from heat and stir mixture aggressively to emulsify. Let sit until pasta is done.,Return reserved pot of water to a boil and cook pasta, stirring occasionally (if using frozen fava beans, add about 2 minutes before pasta is done), until al dente. Drain pasta and fava beans.","*Gricia,I thought if I leave it a bad review the whole recipe will get posted lol. I will adjust my review as soon as the recipe is full and I can make this dish,This is not a review but a question.  You ask for 1 cup of cheese (plus extra for topping), but do not say what to do with it.  My guess is that it was supposed to be added, with the pasta, to the guanciale pot and blended into the oily sauce.  If so, or if used differently, can you correct the recipe?  I doubt it is all just topped onto the pasta."
Spaghetti al Limone With Asparagus,"1 lb. spaghetti,⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil,1 large bunch asparagus, trimmed, thinly sliced on a deep diagonal,4 garlic cloves, smashed,4 3""-long strips lemon zest,½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes,8 large basil leaves,2 lemons, halved,2 oz.

Parmesan and 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid. Cook, tossing vigorously and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until sauce is creamy and emulsified and pasta is coated, about 1 minute. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Remove and discard garlic.,Divide pasta among bowls, placing a lemon strip in each, and top with more Parmesan.","Spectacular flavor! Lessons I learned the first two times I made this: be careful while adding the pasta water--don't do it all at once! Drizzle in until it's a nice emulsion/thick texture to cover the pasta. Some of my asparagus was pretty thick so I sliced the slices lengthwise...and added some leftover sugar snaps that needed to be used, and some carrot ribbons. Tossed some leftover bread crumbs with brown butter and parmesan to top it all...KILLER flavor, and even better the next day. ,I like the ingredients.  The end result, however,  I found to be lacking in taste and texture.  It needs something, but I’m not sure what.  Perhaps crunchy spiced breadcrumbs on top?  ,This was quick, easy and so, so, so amazingly scrumptious! It’s something I will definitely make again! ,Delicious flavours! I personally used an amount of lemon juice to taste, as I felt that the amount of lemon juice in the recipe would be too overwhelming. I also halved the parmesan.,This was the perfect way to use the asparagus in the fridge. Such an easy recipe that's so yummy!,Absolutely delicious!  I used yellow lentil penne but otherwise followed recipe. This is a keeper!  Fresh lemony sauce!,It was yummy. We cut the amount of pasta by half and the cheese was reduced by 2 oz. Still rich, still creamy and lots left ove,I really wanted to make this recipe but did not have asparagus.  I had sugar snap peas and went for it.  Thinly sliced the snap peas lengthwise and followed the recipe and it was awesome!  I quartered the recipe and it still worked great!,I made this tonight along with the shrimp 
ramp-y in the April issue. Both were excellent and were fabulous together! Since we are all quarantined it Almost felt like we were dining in a great Italian trattoria!  Easy- but best to have all prep work done when you start cooking!,This was amazing! Maybe use a little less lemon juice because it was super lemony but I didn't mind. I also added way way more cheese :) i love cheese so yeah hehe ,Amazing recipe! So simple and the flavors from the lemon POP! Made a pot of this and almost ate the entire thing. Parmesan makes the dish so comforting and feel good. Next time I’ll add grilled chicken or shrimp to this! ,Saw the recipe today, made it tonight. Had asparagus in the fridge, basil in the garden: it was meant to be! The recipe was fabulous-lemony, springy, easy, and so very tasty-and will be made often. My only caution is to have everything prepped before starting. I love the asparagus cutting technique-it mimics the pasta in shape, but is remains crisp-but it does take a while to do well.,Yes...thanks. Wonderful flavors. 
Also.... I am so enjoying the TEST Kitchen team sharing on this wild Zoom episode of the . Love the humor. Thank you. "
