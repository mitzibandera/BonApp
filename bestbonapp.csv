Way better than store bought, I will never go back. I agree with the other comment that the way the garlic is prepared ensures it is not overpowering. Easy to make your own with different toppings, though I usually just enjoy it as is. Lasts for about a week in the fridge.,This is my go to hummus dish! I've brought it to parties and served it at home and it never fails to impress! I feel super proud when I say its homemade. ,Great recipe! Very healthy! Very smooth with great flavor!
,My earlier review had his restaurant misspelled.  It's Shaya, not Zia.  Need to focus on one thing at a time.  ,Absolutely love this recipe.  Love Michael Solomonov's book too.  We've been going to New Orleans for Jazz Fest every year for the past who knows how long, and for as long as Michael's restaurant, Zia, has been open, we've been going there for the hummus.  Lots of other great food there but hell, why waste space in my stomach on anything other than his hummus with bread that's fresh out of the oven.  I can tell you that he must be doing something different at the restaurant because I can never replicate the taste.  Maybe it's like drinking wine at a vineyard.  It's never the same at home.  Cheers,This recipe beats any of the finest restaurant versions I have ever had! It was the first time I made hummus from scratch and I think it’s fair to say, it may only be the only one I can have ever again! I used the best of each of the  ingredients; Meyer lemons, Soom tahini, and either Brightland or Wonder Valley olive oil. I also slightly increased the amount of cumin. For the topping I added za’atar! ,I am really disappointed in Bon Appetit allowing a political remark as a review.  Please see Anonymous date 8/31/19.  Please remove this comment as it is offensive.  Political remarks are not a place where the sharing of food brings understanding of other cultures and situations, not denegration.  ,This lovely recipe replaced Ottolenghi's version as my go to. I've made it ""as is"" at least a dozen times to rave reviews, but of course recipes like this one are endlessly adaptable. I roast a whole onion and whole head of garlic for an hour at 300F and then add those to the mix but that may be gilding the lily. I'm grateful to reviewers who mentioned that the baking soda detracts from nutrition. I omitted it and the result was only slightly less silky and still delicious.,Divine!  We don't often have hummus as the grocery store stuff is often pretty bad.  No more, this will be a staple.   Spend the money on a very high quality EVOO..  Thank you BA, excellent as always.
,I usually really like bon appetit, but I’m very disappointed by this recipe. Please try and do just a little bit of basic historical research next time. Maybe instead of giving attention to the perpetrators of violence you should do it the other way around. If you want a legitimate recipe, find a Palestinian, of which there are less and less every day. ,Made this last night and it is the best hummus I have ever made! I simmered a put of canned chickpeas for a while with the baking soda and it really does make a difference. I also love how the garlic is strained -- my boyfriend does not like garlic that much, but this step made it bearable for him! ,I have tried for YEARS to make hummus I liked as much as good restaurant hummus—to no avail.  THIS recipe did it! AMAZING!!! Thank you!!!,I love this recipe! It’s creamy, delicious and so intensely satisfying. ,I love this recipe.  Instead of olive oil on top, I reserved some chickpeas which I mixed with olive oil and za'tar and used it to  top the hummus.  ,This is a great hummus recipe and so much cheaper than buying hummus from the store. I make this recipe with a can of chickpeas versus using dried chickpeas.,This is the best homemade hummus I've ever made. Don't hold back on the olive oil when serving. It really makes the dip perfectly creamy. And cooking the chickpeas aggressively is major. "

The rub was a little spicy for the family so I cut the cayenne in half. Made the corn salsa the night before.  Weather necessitated a change from the grill to the pan, but still turned out phenomenal.  Added  diced avocado, a squeeze of lime juice,  and just a sprinkle of kosher salt when serving.  Already planning on making this again this week. ,The rub was phenomenal. We added a bit extra lime juice to the salsa and some sliced avocado on top.  We also used the rub on some chicken for a person that didn't eat red meat and it tasted great on that too.,This is the BEST steak rub out there.  The addition of the grilled corn, multi-colored tomatoes, paired with the lime and cilantro on top are outstanding.  It is my family's favorite meal and I have picky children.  "

I also feel like it's a perfect drink if you want to mess around with the flavors, add some honey, frozen strawberries, blood orange, who knows! Definitely worth it. Pretty bitter at first but I got use to that super quick.,Written recipe is a bit off. It calls for 2 dropperfuls of elderberry syrup, but Brad pours about 1-2 tbsp of syrup.,I agree with the previous reviewer, this tonic is SUPER bitter as written. However, we modified by adding the juice of one orange, some sliced ginger, and a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  This totally transformed it for the better.  Now it has some sweetness and bite and bitterness too.  ,Incredibly bitter as written. Needed a serious glug of honey."

My husband said it was the best soup ever! I normally follow directions to the letter when trying a recipe for the first time. Having said that, I made three changes to the recipe to suit our tastes: small white beans instead of cannellini beans, hot sausage instead of sweet, and spinach instead of kale. We really liked the way the sausage is prepared for this soup. This is a recipe I will make again and again.,this is one of my main soup staples. it's incredible and impressive and pretty darn easy (i mean, just throw everything in a pot). the one thing I don't do is mix the pork with the wine in the beginning. i tried doing it twice and it gave the pork a really loose mealy texture and i like my sausage in little chunks, not all minced and grimy. so i start by sautéing the onions in oil, then add the sausage, let it brown a bit, and then add wine and everything else. aside from that, everything is tops! ,Delicious!  This soup hits all the categories for me.  Hearty, Fresh, healthy(ish), and packed with flavor!  Can’t wait to make it again. I added some ditalini pasta and less of the croutons.  ,sounds yummy.  i love the combination of sausage, beans, and greens.  why not garlicize the croutons, though?"

I agree the topping is essential, the lemon rounds out the flavours.,This was pretty good! I’m not dying to make it again, but it made a good meal. I like that even though the recipe is vegan, the soup was still very filling thanks to the cashews. The topping was an absolute must to add a little zing to the soup, so don’t skip it! My only small issue was that my topping wasn’t quite as oily as pictured - it was more a chunky mix that mostly sunk down once added to the soup. No biggie if you don’t care about aesthetics.,We live in a third world country and do not have a blender. Do you think I could try mashing everything together the best I can? Would that work? I know it would not look the same but should still taste the same? ,Amazing! I didn't have any cashews so instead used chickpeas, which were half blended with the soup & half added afterwards, and a dollop of yellow miso for extra umami. 

The topping is incredible! Given my lack of cashews I improvised with pumpkin seeds - still an absolute winner... and no doubt considerably cheaper than the original recipe! ,favorite soup we make at Christmas! flavors are phenomenal. ,I made this recipe for dinner tonight, and the flavours are absolutely amazing. My only regret is that I didn't make a double batch! "

I followed the recipe to completion the day prior to serving, and ended up with a brothy stew. Refrigerated overnight, then reduced uncovered at a simmer for a full 8 hours. I added some red chili flakes, and used several glugs of red wine (in addition to the previous white) for the final reduction stage. I also found the breadcrumbs did not add anything to the dish.

My husband and I thought that this was heavenly and so so delicious. We LIVED for the garlic butter, and I can't wait to try this again with the Hellman's, Worcestershire, and curry suggestion below. Forget the haters and try this recipe!,I'm with Alison Roman and ANIKESMOM on this. Save the fussiness for macarons.

I add lemon juice to the steaming water but otherwise this is the recipe I've made for years and everyone devours them. ,Are you kidding? I have been making artichokes for 70 years just exactly this way.
Do you cut a roast or chicken in half ? No! And when you get to the choke all you need is
A spoon to scrape of “fuzz” no different than the extra moment it takes for a chicken leg, lobster,lamb, chop, shall I go on? Very little work for such a lovely heart.
Hellman’s, a little warmed curry power and a dash of worstershire makes a great change
Occasionally. ENJOY!,Anyone who's ever made artichokes sees that this recipe is over-simplified.  The artichoke's anatomy must be the most complex in the veggie kingdom!  What about the ""choke"" (the fuzzy, hairy patch at the top of the stem)?  Are we leaving that for the diner to mess with?  I think not!  I do trim off the thorns (mighty unpleasant to get stabbed by them!)  When I carve a large artichoke, I cut it in half so that cooking time is cut in half as well as carve out the choke.  I'd also recommend wearing rubber gloves as the artichoke tends to darken fingertips and nails during preparation."

Cut apples as close to core as possible into three lobes; set aside. Scatter half of sugar in a heavy 9” skillet and scrape in vanilla seeds; discard pod. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is melted and starting to caramelize, 6–8 minutes (if using a cast-iron skillet, test the color of the caramel by spooning some onto a white plate. It should be pale amber). Add remaining sugar and cook until all sugar is dissolved and has taken on a deep amber color.,Stir in butter, vinegar, and salt. Place apples cut side down in skillet and cook until they start giving up some of their juices and shrink slightly, 5–8 minutes.

Let rest 5 minutes before inverting onto a platter.",March 2015,4.31,"Wow, this was amazing.   One of the best deserts I have ever eaten.  The sweetness of the caramel is mellowed by the juice from the apples and that extra zing from the apple cider vinegar seals the deal.  I cooked mine in a 10 inch cast iron pan (had to remember that old Pi-R-Squared formula to increase the caramel by 25%).  Perhaps it was the pan I used but the puff pastry cooked up very fast, only 20 minutes.  I was able to keep it in the oven another 10 minutes or so at a much lower setting in order to get the apples cooked through.  On that note, I am glad I used small apples as they did cook quickly.  Served within a couple of hours of coming out of the oven, the pastry was still a lovely crispyness.  We had it with a small scoop of Hagen Daz Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.   I would make this exactly the same and I know I will do so many times in the future.  The only thought is that it might be cute to do individual servings using mini cast iron pans.  The only question I have for anyone who reads this is whether they think you could put the whole thing together and let it sit for a couple of hours, then pop it into the oven just as you're sitting down to the first course.   ,This is a great, simple, straightforward recipe. Very pleased with how it turned out. I struggled to fit the apples close together as in the picture so will have to give that another go next time I make it."

Let cool; transfer to airtight containers and chill.",March 2015,3.31,"Not sure what my Canadian friend is talking about, this made heaps of food and does in fact use the whole leek. 

My tips are, joint the wings to make it easier to get an even browning on them. You can soak pasta for 30 minutes and just throw it in for a few minutes to heat at the end. I used a whole sectioned chicken to save a couple of dollars which worked well too.

Very warming and a great depth of flavour ,I have made this recipe so many times and loved it each time!  I primarily use this recipe for the broth and have a few suggestions/adaptations for anyone interested -- 
1) You can easily make the broth in an InstaPot; just brown the meat first and throw everything in.  Use the ""Soup"" setting for 60-120 minutes depending on how rich you want the broth and/or your time.
2) Chicken backs (you'll have to ask at the counter for these) are cheaper than wings and full of the same good stuff that makes the broth flavorful.  I use 1-3 depending on the size.
3) We like spice so I use significantly more black pepper or even crushed red pepper in the broth and then strain it out.,The good news is that this is a delicious tasting soup. The bad news is that for all the steps involved in preparing the stock and assembling the soup, the yield was ridiculous. I got 3 (only 3!) mason jars from the recipe. And that includes putting some (undercooked) egg noodles in the bottom of each jar (they’ll cook when reheated), as well as the carrots and the shredded chicken. A couple issues with the recipe: buying a whole leek to just use a couple leaves to make the herb bundle is just silly; the pearl onions should be peeled before being placed in the soup - this is really time consuming (to quicken it us, you can boil them whole for 3 minutes, let them cool and then “pop” them out of their skins). I ended up putting the pearl onions in the soup, but ditching most of them (sorry - onions in my chicken soup just seems weird, but they did add flavour). I used a white onion in the recipe, quartered, but it was too large - use a smaller cooking onion. Also, my veggies didn’t brown nearly as much as the video shows, not did the wings for that matter. On that subject, I needed 3 batches to not crowd the pan when the wings were browning - if you leave 15-20 minutes per batch that’s nearly an hour for that step alone!

Place on parchment-lined baking sheets that have been coated with nonstick spray. Cover with plastic wrap lightly coated with nonstick spray and freeze solid. Transfer to resealable plastic freezer bags. Steam directly from freezer.",May 2015,3.56,"Hey yall! For freezing these for later; should I steam them once first to cook the meat through and THEN freeze? Or can they go straight to the freezer? ,I've made dumplings in the past, this is my first time making soup dumplings and followed the recipe to a T (H Mart had the Pig's skin, bone, and feet), I did use a pasta maker and cookie cutter to make the dough uniform and thin. The recipe was really easy to follow and each stage worked as intended, really demystified the process, especially with the step-by-step instructions.
Three stars as the end taste was a bit bland and the texture was off. Did some research and found many people emulsify the meat (like when making sausages) and add ginger-infused water to the pork mix. This helped with the flavour and texture greatly. I may double the ginger in the pigs foot mix next time and cook low and slower to unlock more flavour. 
Overall I'll reuse a lot of the elements of this but also blend with other recipe ideas. 
Thanks for providing such clear instruction.,This is a fun recipe, and the only reason why I rated it four stars is because it does take practice to really understand how to roll the dough thinly and also form the pleats on the dumplings. I used a four inch round of damp paper towel to practice. The result though is delicious and 100% worth it.  I made the full recipe, pig feet and all, which was rather hard to source in my suburban Boston area so stock and plain gelatin is what I'll try the next time.  Also will add the gelatin soup cubes separately rather than mixing  them into the filling to ensure equal ratios for all dumplings. This was our New Year's Eve dinner and it was a total success.,Super delicious recipe! Took the short cut and set chicken stock with gelatin, but these are definitely worth the time and effort. ,I had to make these two times before I nailed it. First time I used store-bought wrappers - big mistake. Make the dough from scratch, it’s much better. Also I make a half-batch with dough made of 1 c sifted flour mixed with 3/4 tsp salt dissolved in 1/4 c warm water. First time I also used a wooden roller; the marble roller is much better. Shortcuts that actually worked was 1) using the cuisinart for the filling instead of hand chopping and 2) I used chicken stock (homemade) instead of making the broth with the pig foot - ick. GREAT DUMPLINGS!!!,Claire is best!

i've seen various takes on French onion soup, one of which used a bleu cheese topping on the toasted bread.  that intrigues me.  so does the Petit Trois version with the two cheeses.  but the veal stock and topper of toasted bread with melted cheese are ESSENTIAL (did i already stress that?)!"

The frosting wasn't runny, but the coconut cream makes it less thicker than regular buttercream frosting and has a duller shine. It was easy to spread, but personally, I would've preferred regular frosting because of the texture and taste. I also didn't get much coconut flavor. ,Based on the other comments' mentions of sinkage in the middle, I decided to bake it in two separate layers and use regular flour. The cake turned out fine and was pretty good! It's like a carrot-less carrot cake. ,The cake tasted fine, but collapsed in the middle! The frosting was also very runny and rather difficult to work with. This recipe should be re-examined and adjusted— I’m sure it can be great!,I don't know what I did wrong, but the cake cratered in the middle.  I was really looking forward to serving this dessert at my holiday dinner tomorrow with my gluten-free guests, but now I'm going to have to find something else.  Also, just an FYI in case you decide to try the cake, you need to use a 9X3"" pan; a 9X2 would definitely not be high enough (for the sides of the cake anyway!  my sunken middle would fit!),It is in the oven, and I'm looking forward to the final product.  There appears to be an error in the instructions.  There was no way all that batter would go into a 9 in CAKE pan.  I instead used a 9 inch SPRINGFORM pan and am hoping that will work out well.  "

The only thing I would change is maybe using a different cheese. Cotija doesn’t melt very well.,Flavors were good, but if I followed the roasting and baking temperatures given in this recipe, I would've burned the house down. The tomatillos/peppers charred and burned the juices to a crisp. I had to cut the temperature down on the enchiladas to keep them from completely burning as well.,In the past, every single recipe I have made has been very good.  This is the first one that disappointed.  After all the working of making the sauce, and the baking time, I had really high hopes.  I suggest more salt than you think it needs and more spices in general.  It turned out bland, and mushy.  "

Modifications I made:  yes I only used a couple tablespoons of the grease. Glad I did.  I ended up with 12 enchiladas with the ¼ cup measure.  I don’t know how they are stuffing 1 lb of beef into only 6 tortillas. This also means I used 2 smaller glass dishes (6 per dish) instead of the 1 big 13x9 inch dish to bake in.  I used 4 cups veggie broth (1 of the cartons from the store) and then 1 cup of water, because that’s just what I had on hand.  It tasted just fine.  This was a fantastic and true enchilada recipe.  I wouldn’t called it spicey but with that much chili powder it has a very strong earthy smokey flavor.  Adjust and use a ⅓ cup or a ¼ cup based on your preferences. ,How would the preparation change if you use flour tortillas? Would you still fry and sauce them before assembly? I know using flour tortillas is a big no no but my family prefers them to corn :(,I made this *almost* exactly as recommended and it was SO GOOOOOD. The only changes I made were:
I used 12 tortillas instead of 8 (looking back, 8-10 would probably be best)
On recommendation from a review, I reserved the beef fat and only used as much as I needed
I had just enough sauce and for the love of all that is Rick Martinez, please, USE A HALF CUP OF CHILI POWDER. I know it's a lot, just try it. You won't be sorry.  ,This has to be wrong. Either it's meant for twice the number of enchiladas or the proportions of the ingredients are off. This is nothing like any enchilada I've ever had.,So much better than the mass market kits. It was slightly spicy and earthy.,Would definitely put a little under 1/4 cup of chili powder in this dish. I also only had 4 cups of chicken broth which worked great, I still have leftover sauce. I feel like it would be too thin and I would yield way more than I needed if I added another cup. Also I would lightly fry 22 tortillas before dipping them. I’m not sure why it calls for only 8 tortillas. I filled 2 baking dishes of 6 inch enchiladas using 1.45lbs of ground beef!! Amazing recipe tho! Topped it with sour cream and cilantro ,Very good flavor, but way too greasy.  Next time I will pour off all but about 1 TBL of the grease from the meat before cooking the onions, peppers and garlic.  That should help.  It also seems to be a lot of sauce for 8 enchiladas.  I chose to make them casserole style (SO MUCH EASIER) and simply dipped the tortillas in the sauce (which also skips the oil to soften them) and lined the pan, then layered the meat and cheese, and repeated with a second layer of everything finishing with the cheese.  Baked at 375 for 35 minutes.  I used 10 corn tortillas, but will probably use more next time since there is so much sauce.  I think you could easily use 18 (6 per layer with 3 layers).  ,I was disappointed because the chili powder overpowered the dish. I'd reduce it by half or more! (Or maybe add double the tomatoes to balance it out),I recommend having 2 people to make this recipe.  It's also important to fry the tortillas or else they fall apart really easily.  It's very tasty, though! I took it to a potluck, and they were an absolute hit.,That's a LOT of chili powder!  I used half of the called-for amount and it was plenty flavorful. "

Dealing with such a hot griddle indoors is a little tricky, but the burgers turned out great and my fam was happy. I definitely think american cheese is a necessity for that perfect 'almost fast food' taste. I dont think anything else can parallel the melty-creamy texture and taste of american. 
These things cook fast, so don't overestimate their cooking time. If you stack them as they finish theyll keep eachother warm and cook a little longer, if you're worried about undercooking. 
Tl;dr:  fast and delicious. 10/10,This recipe came out great! Although I did make a few changes--added some bacon, BBQ sauce, and some jalapenos. It was very juicy and the brioche bun was fantastic.,Thanks, Carla for the wonderful and entertaining video.  Is there a recipe for the special sauce?  I know you mentioned the ingredients in the video.

Thanks.,Easy, perfect and delicious ,Nagi, Bourdain would disagree with you. From his book Appetites: ""Cheddar or processed American? One must ask oneself constantly what one is willing to sacrifice for presumed 'quality.' American cheese, clearly, is texturally and structurally superior as a binding agent—and has the added force of tradition on its side. Lettuce? I’m not a fan. I’ll have my salad on the side. But I understand the desire for crunch. If you’re putting mesclun or baby arugula on your burger, though, Guantánamo Bay would not be an unreasonable punishment. Use finely shredded iceberg. Or maybe romaine. Period."",While I appreciate the simplicity of the burger itself, I find your opinion on the type of cheese and the fact that you put the absolutely wrong type of lettuce on it troubling. "

Store tightly covered at room temperature.",October 2015,4.17,"So So Good! Just really wish this recipe was in weighted measurements.,I made this recipe for the first time and here's what I did. No food processor so grinding the flour mix and nuts was a pain in my little blender. Used mix of walnut and pecan (70/30 ratio). Used freshly ground cardamom using a spice grinder. I added extra couple pinches of salt worrying that the cake would taste only sweet, would add more next time. Made my own pomegranate syrup the night before using another recipe with fresh pomegrates, white sugar and lemon juice (Still haven't had time to go searching stores for the syrup). My pears were slightly under-ripe (not tender but still juicy). Used some fruit juice (pineapple mix) I had in the fridge (since its only 3 tbsp for the recipe any kind of juice would be fine I think). The syrup came together really well and had a nutty flavour I really like (kinda like roasted sweet potatoes?). I recommend reducing it more than you might think (low and slow) and testing if it sets up by putting a drop on a cutting board and checking if it stiffens after a few min. Mixing the batter, I used lemon zest instead of orange, less sugar (1/2 cup less but I want to reduce it further) and 1/2 cup less oil (which was a blend of olive and canola). 1 cup of oil seemed like a lot of fat, not sure if it affects the outcome. I was skeptical of using all olive oil (I only had extra virgin). Batter came out thick and sticky.  Baked for 65 min (though it could have gone another 10 no problem, I expect it would have carmelized a bit more). The edges form a bit of a crispy crust right freshly baked. The bottom didn't carmelize as much as the photo, less so in the center but still a deep colour around the edges. This part is so good! It rose a lot more than I expected in my 10 inch pan. It set up really nicely. I think if there was the full amount of oil it might feel a bit heavy, but also last longer in the fridge. Maybe 3/4 cup of oil is the perfect amount? Definitely reduce the sugar of the cake as the caramel and pears give the most sweetness. Next time I'd love to try lime zest and leaving some whole pieces of nuts on the base to caramelize with the pears. It's a hearty and beautiful cake that goes well with tea!,AMAZING!!! This nutty cake has the perfect qualities to be served with a cup of tea, and an unbelievable lightness despite the rich topping. I actually cooked my pears in advance and accidentally burned the syrup, so I redid a half recipe of the syrup and quickly thickened it with a cornstarch slurry rather than reducing it. I also used a 10 1/2"" pan and still had a lot of batter leftover! Made a separate 4"" cake instead after seeing reviews citing a molten centre (usually caused when pans are overfilled). I used fresh pears from the farm that were odd sizes so maybe the ratio of pear to batter was the issue. I also baked it for a total of 70 minutes before it was no longer wobbly in the centre, but this cake was well worth the wait.,DELICIOUS! Such a nice cake, that only took 40 minutes to prepare! Cooked perfectly in just under an hour and went down like a treat. 
I didn't have some of the ingredients so I made some substitutions: cinnamon instead of cardamom, sugar and blackcurrant juice and cranberry juice instead of pomegranate nectar, ground almonds instead of blended walnuts, melted butter instead of olive oil,  2tsp baking powder and no baking soda.
Everybody LOVED it and asked for it to be made again. It is so easy to eat more of this light and versatile cake, absolutely delicious. If you feel that there is oo much sauce to put into the cake tin, save it to use as a sauce for the cooked cake!
,after one hour of baking it appeared done. when i unmolded it from pan, it liquefied all over counter. scooped it back into pan to bake for another hour. it was delicious!,This cake is amazing. I made it with a mix of 3/4 whole wheat flour 1/4 buckwheat flour and coconut sugar instead of white sugar. It was a crowd pleaser! The only change I would make is just to add fresh whipped cream next time.,This is so unbelievably sweet - half the sugar, at least. A cup of olive oil seems wholly unnecessary as well. ,I made this recipe, taking care to cook the pomegranate syrup down extra and let it set up before pouring the batter. At 60 minutes a toothpick came out clean but it had a little wobble to it so I left it an extra 10 minutes. After I took it out and let it cool, I was sad to find it still batter in the center! It wasn't just a little underdone-- batter came spilling out. I'm not sure what went wrong, but an internal temp recommendation would be handy. ,This cake is hands down one of my favorites. I can't remember what year it was, but it was on the cover of one of bon appetite's fall issues. I have made it at least 10 times since and so far anyone I have shared it with asks for the recipe. I think it takes a few tries before you can perfect it, I must say my latest attempt was my best. I'll note that chilling the pears and syrup fully is important as well as reducing the syrup enough. In the beginning I did not have access to pomegranate molasses so I subbed a reduction of pomegranate juice, which doesn't do the cake justice! Anyways, make this...make it many, many times. You will fall in love. "

I'll go with 1 1/2 tablespoons next time.  But I'm gonna make them again for sure!! ,Love this recipe! Been making it regularly for 5 years now (since it was originally published in their magazine). 

It freezes beautifully. And fries up really nicely from frozen. I usually make a double batch when I make these and freeze them on trays then transfer to a gallon freezer bag. Makes for insanely easy weeknight meals! 

I see a lot of complaints about the salt in the comments. They use Diamond Kosher, which is one of the least salty salts by volume. Look up conversations for whatever salt you have. 

,These were delicious! I got into another project so I soaked my chickpeas for way too long, I think that’s why the batter was a little wet but I added extra flour and let it sit for a while. I was able to form them and they stayed together when frying 🤗,I followed this exactly per the directions and video above. Everything turned out incredible well! I will definitely make this again. The only caution I have is for anyone trying to fry theses falafel using an electric stovetop - the temperature management is the hardest part, so just be patient with that. Otherwise, I recommend this 100%. Do not skip on the sauce either!

 [and for the comments noting this being high in salt, I used the exact amount and had no issues. Perfect amount.],As per usual, Bon Appetit delivers the best recipes in the test kitchen market! I fried these in a shallow pan of oil and made them into patties instead of balls. They were herby, fresh and delicious! To those rating this recipe 1 star because you used canned chickpeas: The reason you don't use canned is because canned chickpeas add too much moisture and rid the falafel of everything giving it texture by using soft, overcooked chickpeas.
I can't wait to make these again and may experiment with different herbs like mint or dill.,Yes definitely but add much less salt. I used canned chick peas and added more flour to get the right consistency. Delicious!,Amazing.. never thought of adding baking powder to falafal and it did wonders for the texture. Also a great move to pulse the chickpeas separately for better control. Never had the bravery to deep fry falafel before and I don't think I can ever go back. 
Didn't have jalepeno, but threw in some cayenne powder. I also used fresh ground green cardamon and coriander seeds, a little more cumin, and a dash of smoked paprika (all for my own taste, nothing wrong with the recipe!)
As for the salt content mentioned by others.. if you used 2.5tbs of table salt, of course it will be too salty! Not all salts are created equal.. (I used diamond crystal kosher)
And for those asking: No no no! Do not use canned chickpeas! It is not hard to soak dried chickpeas in water! ,I followed the recipe to the letter, except instead of using soaked chickpeas, I used canned ones. The falafel held its shape before being fried, but after 1 minute in the hot-oil pan, the spheres turned into mush. ,Fantastic (partly because I've only ever used store-bought falafel mix). This is so fresh and flavourful, and surprisingly easy to make. I used rice flour instead of chickpea flour, because that's what I had on hand. (Yes, adjust salt to your own taste, as others have suggested.) I made the green tahini sauce as well - also a must. Seconds and thirds were had by all when this was served. ,This recipe is amazing, with some adaptations. Even my falafel resisting wife loves them! 
I only use about 2 teaspoons of salt , half cilantro and half mint, nix the cardamom all together and use cornstarch instead of the chickpea flour as it’s easier to find. I pan fry this in about an inch of oil and squash the falafel so it’s more flat .Turns out great! You definitely wanna make the tahini sauce, that stuff is amazing. Just make sure you get a good, not so bitter tahini . ,ST Paul and any other seasoning comments...is really on you.  As a cook...you should know ratios of salt relative to your taste...and you can taste along the way.   Sure...most cooks know this but a reminder doesn't hurt...specially in defense of the BA TEAM...not that they need defending. ,The herbs were on point but this was an absolute salt bomb. We ended up tossing most of it. ,I used canned chickpeas and that was my downfall. Too much moisture! I did add extra chickpea flour but it wasn’t enough, so the first few balls just disintegrated in the oil. I added about 4 tblsp more flour and reformed the balls, and that worked. I only ended up with 8 balls in the end but they were delish! Also, I did reduce the salt but I use Morton’s kosher and know that BA uses Diamond crystal and they always say to reduce with Morton’s. Plus it easier to just add more if it’s lacking in the end. Next time I will soak my own chickpeas!,I think it’s our new vegetarian go-to! I followed directions exactly. Not too salty at all if you make sure to use kosher salt as directed. I was nervous about the jalapeño with my kids, but not a single word of complaint. Easy, delicious and plated beautifully. Oh and FAST. This will be great for weeknights when there isn’t a lot of time!,I made these without any salt and with canned chickpeas instead of dried and they turned out delicious!!! Make sure to blend everything thoroughly, I noticed my parsley was too course. But they still turned out great!,This was really good. I made my own chickpea flour in the vitamix with dried chickpeas and added two additional tablespoons of it. Only did a tsp of salt I would probably do 1.5 tsp if I made this again. I recommend erring on the side of smaller rather than larger balls since you can fit more balls in pita if they’re smaller. (I have no clue how big ping pong balls are),I haven't tried this receipe yet, but would it be alright if I used canned chickpeas instead of dried? Thanks!,I did a subpar job mincing up the chickpeas, so it was a little bit too nutty, but even so, absolutely delicious. The falafels held together great, fried nicely, and tasted great. ,This is so good! But a definite warning on the amount of salt. Luckily, I saw another review about it being too salty before I had finished... It was too salty before I had finished with salt like the video showed, and I left all salt out of the sauce... But alas, it was still too salty! Tone is down! ,I had such high hopes and was looking forward to making this all week, but honestly, the salt kills it. It was way too salty it was unedible. I should have just added salt as I was going, but 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt in the falafel is overkill. To make matters worse, as per the recipe 2 teaspoons and more in one cup of tahini made the sauce way too salty. I honestly couldn't eat a bite of it.,First time making falafel from scratch.  I used dried hulled split fava beans in place of the chickpeas, then had to add more chickpea flour to get the right molding consistency.

I don't deep fry, so I made patties and pan fried them in olive oil.  Husband and kid both devoured them - some of the best falafel I've ever eaten (and yes, I've eaten at L'As du Fallafel in Paris :).,This is delicious! I made it for the second time last night. It's very nicely seasoned and the balls fried up beautifully. In terms of recipe notes, I think 1 minute is way too long to process the onion/herb ingredients. 10 seconds is probably more like it. I then drained off the liquid from the onions. I also found the raw falafel mix was a little challenged to hang together, so I added additional chick pea flour at several points in the assembly process, and it seemed to work fine. I also formed balls a bit smaller than golf balls. I was a little worried that would dry them out with frying, but they turned out great. For an easy but wholesome serving suggestion I served the falafel in a pita with a bag of prechopped broccoli slaw and diced bread and butter pickles. A yummy crowd pleaser!"
Vegan Chocolate Tart with Salted Oat Crust,"1¼ cups old-fashioned oats,¾ cup whole wheat flour,⅓ cup virgin coconut oil, melted, slightly cooled,¼ cup light agave syrup (nectar),2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder,¾ teaspoon kosher salt,½ teaspoon ground cinnamon,½ teaspoon instant espresso powder,1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder,7 ounces vegan dark chocolate, melted, slightly cooled,⅔ cup light agave syrup (nectar),2 teaspoons vanilla extract,⅔ cup plus 1 teaspoon virgin coconut oil, melted, slightly cooled,¼ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more,2 tablespoons old-fashioned oats,1 tablespoon demerara sugar,Flaky sea salt,A 9-inch-diameter or a 13¾x4½-inch tart pan with removable bottom","Preheat oven to 350˚.

Add cocoa and let sit 5 minutes. Add melted chocolate, agave syrup, vanilla, ⅔ cup coconut oil, and ¼ tsp. kosher salt and process until mixture is very smooth and thick, about 30 seconds.,Scrape filling into cooled tart shell and smooth top (if making tart in a rectangular shell, you may have a little filling left over; save for another use, like truffles). Tap tart lightly against counter to pop any air bubbles in filling.,Cook oats and remaining 1 tsp. coconut oil in a small skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until oats are toasted, about 3 minutes. Gradually add half of demerara sugar, stirring constantly, until sugar is melted, then remove from heat and stir in remaining demerara sugar just to coat. Season with kosher salt; let oat mixture cool.,Scatter oat mixture over tart, sprinkle with sea salt, and chill until filling is set, at least 1 hour.,Cut chilled tart into slices with a dry, hot knife; let sit at room temperature 15–20 minutes before serving.,Do Ahead:, Tart can be made 2 days ahead. Once filling is set, cover and keep chilled.",October 2015,4.75,"This is an incredibly decadent dessert (in taste and visual appeal). I made it in the 13x4 tart pan and had almost half the filling left over to make truffles with. I toasted the topping about twice as long as indicated, to get it really crunchy, but the chilling step takes away from that crunch.,Great recipe, but it is a bit confusing about where to add the oats the second time. We messed up and added them to the filling by mistake. Perhaps it would be helpful to have a line delineating these from the filling ingredients in the ingredients recipe at the top of the page. Happy cooking!,DELICIOUS! An amazing, rich and decadent chocolate tart, I didn't have any agave syrup or coconut oil so I used maple syrup and very saturated sugar water, and butter, they worked perfectly. While making the filling, I wasn't sure that it would set so I added some more cocoa powder (mixed with a little hot water to make a thick liquid/ thin paste) and added this to the filling mix. 
At first, I wasn't sure whether to put the oaty bits on top of the tart but when I did it looked amazing and added a lot of character to the piece. In order to get slightly larger oat bits, I added more sugar to the oats as I toasted them (around 1.5tbs instead of 0.5tbs)."

Serve with lime wedges.",October 2015,3.8,"One of my all time favorite bon appétit recipes! Ripe tomatillos are a must, otherwise it can end up tasting a bit bitter.  I usually add chicharrónes (or well-cooked bacon in a pinch) and avocado on top as a garnish. ,I've made this delicious stew several times. The combination of flavors and bright green color are marvelous. ,I'm not sure if we just used unripe tomatillos or what but this recipe was a little *too* bright. The heat level was way too much for us too but that could have been easily adjusted by using less of the chile seeds. "
Double Ginger Sticky Toffee Pudding,"½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan,2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan,10 ounces Medjool dates, chopped (about 2 cups),1 teaspoon baking soda,2 teaspoons baking powder,½ teaspoon kosher salt,1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar,2 teaspoons finely grated peeled ginger,3 large eggs, room temperature,½ cup chopped crystallized ginger,1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar,1 cup heavy cream,¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter,1 teaspoon kosher salt,Demerara sugar (for serving),A 9-cup Bundt pan","Preheat oven to 350˚.

Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface.,Bake cake until top is firm and springs back when gently pressed with your fingers and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35–45 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Let cake cool in pan 10 minutes before turning out onto rack, then let cool another 20 minutes (cake should still be warm).,Bring brown sugar, cream, butter, salt, and 2 Tbsp. water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring to melt butter. Cook, stirring, until mixture is thick enough to coat a spoon, 5–8 minutes. Let cool slightly.,Poke holes all over warm cake with a toothpick. Wipe out Bundt pan; pour a third of sauce into pan.

Let sit until cake absorbs sauce, 15–20 minutes.,Turn cake out onto rack (it may not come out at first but will eventually release) and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Serve cake with remaining toffee sauce. If the sauce has cooled by the time you’re ready to serve, gently reheat just to warm through.,Do Ahead:, Cake can be made 1 day ahead; store tightly covered at room temperature. Cover and chill leftover sauce. Gently reheat before serving.",October 2015,4.67,"I made this for New Years and it was a hit! The cake was moist and the perfect amount of crumbly. I could have cooked the toffee sauce a bit longer to achieve the darkness pictured, but the lighter toffee tasted great. I used larger skewers to poke holes in the top and the stick end of my electric mixer whisks to poke holes in the bottom. I also used all of the sauce to soak the cake and let it sit in the pan soaking for 2 hours. ,Delicious, and definitely a showstopper! The cake was gorgeous. Mine was almost as dark as the photo. I would definitely make this again, but I think I would skip the inversion back into the bundt pan step—I did not do this elegantly (and I had to enlist help) and my beautiful bundt broke in half. I think the cake is delicious even without the additional soaking step, as well, so I’d skip the fuss and just brush the top with a pastry brush and be done with it.  Just my two cents, though, and not a flaw in the recipe! Thanks for hitting it out of the park yet again, Claire :)
,This cake was not overly difficult and really beautiful. Loved the flavor, but between dates and caramel it is very sweet, so just know that going in! Mine was a little dry and only baked for 35. Could be my altitude (almost 8000 ft) or the fact that I used convection - would check it at 30 min next time. I also found the sauce only penetrated the very outer layer (about 1/8 to 1/4 inch). But with more drizzled over each slice when served, it was plenty of caramel. I'll definitely make it again and my technique might improve! ,I’ve been making this recipe for years and it’s simply the best. If you mash/the dates properly and follow the recipe, I find it turns out perfect. Moist with a tender crumb, and the salty sweet caramel sauce with the double ginger is divine. It’s my all-time favorite dessert. Very sweet and rich, but that’s what dessert if for! ,Real sticky toffee pudding is steamed, not baked.,I found the recipe good overall but the cake was a little dry. I would increase the butter next time I try. I loved the bite of the crystallized ginger. My sauce did not soak into the cake in 3 hours even after poking the cake with skewers. Maybe I need to give a longer soaking time and make larger holes."

Seen so many gloopy, blush sauce drenched plates out dining. Not for me. But this looked so simple? 
It is and it’s damn good! I didn’t have vodka and used Sake, and it was still alarmingly good! You can half the sauce and it works, or make the whole batch and think you’re saving some for a later time... only to eat it at 3am! ,As the world is in quarantine, one of the things I have found I miss the most is the experience of sharing a meal at restaurants. In times when going out to have dinner at Jon & Vinny's is not an option, having this recipe available to make at home was really the sunshine on a (literally and emotionally) cloudy day. This pasta is so delicious. Like, unbelievably, ""best pasta I've ever made"", delicious. I couldn't recommend this highly enough!,Would give this recipe 5 stars. However, I do have some suggestions to make it even better. Instead of plain fusilli, try using red lentil fusilli, it adds a great (healthy) kick. Also, my first time making it I didn’t have regular vodka on hand, only orange flavored vodka, but after making it with both the orange vodka DEFINITELY won. It gives the sauce a zesty aroma without tasing like orange.,Honestly the easisest and most yummy dish ever!  I have to make this at least once a week !!! really recommend !,I registered just to leave a review. It is by far my favourite pasta dish ever. The ingredients and the measurements are spot on. My boyfriend said that this is a restaurant quality dish, and that is high praise coming from him. ,This recipe is excellent. Super simple and luxurious. Don't be afraid if, once you finish caramelizing the tomato paste and you add the cream, you have a greasy, separated puddle. The heat will bring it back together (along with stirring). Recipe is perfect but I was nervous at that point, so just so you know, it will be fine. ,The whole family loved it! I whisked in about 4 dollops of ricotta that I had on hand right after I stirred in the cream. It was so good! ,Honestly so great:) I added some roasted red peppers n was v v v good,A hit! I will halve the red pepper next time and probably 1.5x the sauce (we prefer ours a bit saucier). What a great flavor. ,This is basically pasta tikka masala, right?
,This is maybe my favorite pasta recipe I’ve ever made (and I love making pasta!). I just licked the bowl with a spatula.... do yourself a favor and make this now. 😍💯😋,Whoa. This is amazing. I never write reviews of recipes, but I felt compelled given how happy I was making and eating this. It is super simple. It doesn't require random, one-off ingredients. And it was so so so good. This definitely is going into my favorites and part of the regular rotation. ,This sauce is delicious, and super easy to make! I didn't have any vodka on hand, so I subbed in some chicken stock, which worked out well. Will definitely be making this again in the future.,This recipe is INCREDIBLE. I've made it close to 8 times now, and it is a hit every time. I double (maybe triple) the heavy cream and halve the red pepper flakes. One of my favorite recipes of all time. "

Let cool slightly on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.,Do Ahead:, Cookies can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.",October 2015,4.77,"I wasn't as impressed with these cookies as some other reviewers. In terms of textural contrast, I much prefer, David Leite's Chocolate Chip Cookies (see NYT) and--for variety--Salted Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies (also from the NYT).  Both have chewier interiors and lighter, crispier exteriors. Also, I think the chopped chocolate makes the cookies less interesting than they'd be if all the discs were left whole (as in the two NYT recipes). It makes them too homogeneous.,These cookies are amazing! I will definitely be making these again. I added a tsp of vanilla extract, but I think next time I will also add a 2nd tsp of bourbon. I couldn't find 72% wafers, so I used a 60%. I definitely think the 72% would be better though.,I don't usually bake cookies, but have been in pursuit of the best recipe. And these might be my favorite yet! They have a really delicious taste - not super sweet, but still very rich. I went the fancy route and chopped up some dark chocolate, though I honestly think you can just use chocolate chips. They're just aesthetically prettier with chunks. I'd definitely recommend dark chocolate, but maybe not the super dark chocolate that I used. These are big cookies, and I assume the size is necessary to get the effect of the inside being gooey and chewy, with the edges being a little more crisp. I think my only other note is that I went with about 3 TBSP of bourbon, and while the aroma in the kitchen definitely had a whiff of bourbon, the taste didn't really come through as much as I would have liked. I'll probably add even more next time!,Swapped the butter for brown butter of the same amount without looking into whether that would be a good idea or not. Texture came out really different because of this, but decidedly not bad. I'll probably try again w brown butter, upping the amount if butter and maybe slightly decreasing the flour. The flavor is divine, the kick of salt on top is perfect. I use half pulverized chocolate chips and half wafers bc that's all I had. Definitely would recommend. ,These cookies are like the metaphysical chocolate chip cookie,Yum! I used 1 T bourbon. Mixed flaky sea salt with some vanilla powder from gourmet oil store. Used chunked chips 62% dark. Added some extra reg semisweet chips. Dough is thick. A bit hard to tell when they’re done. Don’t overtake. Mine took 13 mins. ,I'm a little confused, I keep reading the directions and I'm not seeing the point in which we drive our Chevy to the levy.,The end result is absolutely five stars, but I have a couple issues with the recipe. A teaspoon of whiskey is nothing. I used 2 tablespoons, might use 3 next time (and rye whiskey, not bourbon - why would you use rye flour and not rye whiskey?). Also, chocolate wafers is a fussy ingredient; chocolate chips or chunks is just fine! And I didn't do vanilla salt, but just sprinkled sea salt on top before baking. And they were great!,Easily the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever used. The reaction to nearly every first bite was a brief pause, followed by ""oh my god..."" I doubled the whiskey, but I'm a bit of a lush and love the flavor. Run, don't walk to your kitchen and make these today!,This is cookie perfection. I made these yesterday and they aren't too much effort and are delicious."

It was well worth the labor. I'd recommend every home baker attempt doughnuts at least once. It felt like a rite of passage. ,My wife ordered these instead of a birthday cake, and it was a definite win.  I adjusted flour some for altitude, and was generous on the board rolling it out and while it looked like it might fall apart when I turned them, I had no problems.  Finished with an amaretto whip cream...most excellent birthday breakfast!,This did not turn out well. The first couple I tried cooking completely fell apart so I added more flour. They then held together but weren’t cooking inside before they got dark. I turned down the temperature and they finally cooked through and we’re golden brown. The problem after that was they had soaked in a lot of oil and were more like a churro.,Flavor was good, but dough just was a huge struggle. It felt like there was maybe too much baking soda, and the donuts fell apart when frying. We ended up salvaging it with a lot of extra flour, and doing just donut holes as the full donut still fell apart. The flavor was fantastic, and the donuts holes were a hit, just not worth all the work and troubleshooting at the end. ,Taste good but fell apart, I adjusted for altitude but they still fell apart and they were kind of greasy ,Trying to recreate New England cider donuts - these were delicious and pretty darn close.  I’d add more nutmeg and maybe 1/4-1/2 tsp more salt.  The reduced cider and apple butter flavors really come through.  The donuts fried up beautifully.  Will definitely make again.  ,Amazing donuts. Delicious, craggy, moist, and super flavorful. I will definitely be making these again! I wish I could post a picture so everyone could see how beautiful they turned out!!"

I also really appreciate the provided nutritional content. This recipe is getting added to my regular rotation.,Not the most memorable recipe, but delicious and very week-night accessible.

Season with salt, if needed.,Serve beans topped with feta, oregano, and more red pepper flakes and drizzled with oil, with lemon for squeezing over.",March 2015,3.87,"This was my first recipe I made in the Instant Pot. I am a huge fan of Gigantes and spent a lot of time reading recipes to find the right one. I ended up trying this one because it was simple and didn't have anything that I found surprising like celery or cinnamon. Although I was a bit skeptical at the same time and wasn't expecting much.

It turned out SO WELL! I can't believe how rich the tomato broth ended up. Just like the ones I've had at restaurants. It really was delicious and I will be keeping this around. I took the advice of another review and halved the salt, added 1 tsp dried basil and dried oregano when I added the garlic. I also added about 1 TBSP of tomato paste to the sauteed onion right before deglazing (not sure if this made a difference or if it just got blasted away during the pressure cooking) and another 1 tbsp of tomato paste once I added the canned tomatoes.

Bon Appetit wins again!,This was DELICIOUS! I made it basically exactly as the recipe except I added a tsp each of basil and oregano to the beans before pressure cooking. It was a tad salty for me so I may half the amount of salt next time.,My kids literally cheer when I add this to our menu. I’ve made it in the pressure cooker but lately I’ve been doing it on the stove with canned butter beans. I follow directions up until adding the beans, but instead skip ahead to adding tomato and juices and let simmer on the stove without water. The beans don’t take on as much of the flavor but it’s still a huge hit. Not sure why it’s so hard to find a variety of dried beans locally but improvising is life. "

Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.",April 2015,3.23,"I just made this recipe for Easter and it complemented all our other dishes wonderfully. My family absolutely loved it. I also had the same problem as another user with the packages of puff pastry. I ended up using 1 and 1/2 sheets which worked pretty well except it was a little hard to transfer onto the serving dish after baking. Overall I really liked this recipe, but I think it might need some garlic or something to elevate it just a tad. ,Yes, this was good. It was beautiful to look at and the puff pastry made it very special to eat. Light and airy. I have a few comments, though. The recipe says 1 package of puff pastry. I used Pepperidge Farms brand and the package contains two squares of puff pastry. One square was too small for all of the toppings. I used 2/3 of the 2nd square to make a rectangle shape and that worked well. The ricotta cream was so creamy, but a bit plain in flavor. I might add some garlic next time. I also added 4 oz of fresh mushrooms sauteed with the carrots, as one reviewer suggested. The herbs are magnificent on this recipe, too. ,This is a go-to recipe I take to parties and prepare for home dinner parties. Looks beautiful. Tastes yummy and is always a hit. Easy to prepare and is great room temp the next day. I have sometimes added mushrooms to add more taste. Highly recommend. ,I made this tart for Mother's Day.  Not only was it simple, it was also delicious!  The caramelized onions (I used Vidalia) & carrots were a nice balance to the creamy ricotta, & the dill gave it a fresh, spring time flavor.  It was good warm, and also cold the next day. Just be sure to check the tart early, as my phyllo dough got a bit browner than desired in the minimum suggested baking time.  I will definitely make this again!,Not very good. This was tasteles. I think the recipe needs some work ,Solid recipe"
Classic Martini,"4 ounces Beefeater gin,¾ ounce Noilly Prat dry vermouth,1 lemon","Holding a large (preferably 1"") cube of ice in the palm of your hand, use the back of a stirring spoon to crack it into large pieces; place in a mixing glass. Repeat with enough ice to fill glass. Add gin and vermouth and, using a bar spoon, rapidly stir 50 times in a circular motion (the outside of the shaker will become very cold and frosty).,Strain martini through a Hawthorne strainer (or a large slotted spoon) into a chilled Nick and Nora glass. Strain any excess cocktail into a sidecar set over ice (or a small glass in a bowl of ice).,Using a small serrated knife, remove a 1"" piece of peel from lemon; it should be stiff enough to provide some resistance (some white pith is okay). Twist peel over drink to express oils, then rub around rim of glass. Float peel, yellow side up, in martini.",April 2015,3.59,"1. You have to chill the gin for one hour in the freezer;
2. The bottle has to be stored upside down;
3. At minimum, you must be prepared to make at least four martinis per batch to allow the flavors of the vermouth and gin to mix properly; and
4. If you do end up using olives for garnish - remember to dry each olive with a linen free towel so that they can properly macerate. ,Putting the gin in the freezer is a nice idea if you’re working with low quality ice that’s small or has a lot of surface area for melting, as it would dilute too fast with room temperature gin. 

What I suggest for party martinis, is making them in a larger batch, Diluting to taste not temperature, and putting the diluted Martini in a bottle in the freezer for an hour or so before you plan on serving them. Then you can pour into chilled glasses and it will be ice cold for your guests, who can garnish them however they’d like!,For the person who suggested putting gin in the freezer; this would prevent proper dilution when stirring in ice.  So no it shouldn’t go in the freezer unless you’re making a cold cocktail that doesn’t require dilution.,What ? A lemon twist and no olive ? You lost me.,Put the gin in the freezer."

Going to attempt an air fryer version to see if I can cut down on fat and preserve the goodness. ,Has anyone tried baking these to make them a bit healthier? I think 150 calories per fritter is a bit much and most of it probably comes from the oil.,This recipe worked for me. Note that I used a ""giant"" zucchini from the garden. Partial peeling and coring was enough to get a good result.

I used a mandoline (with fine cross blades) instead of a box grater. I think that it gives a better, less mushed, zucchini/potato texture. It also allows you to play with long-stringy cuts. Squeezing the veg with your hand works just as good as that towel thing in the vid, and you can easily repeat until you're satisfied; the residual water in the veg does make the dough happen properly.

Definitely keep the heat not more than med; this stuff can burn.
,Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. Cannot overstate the importance of salting then letting the liquid release from the grated vegetables! "

I've made multiple variations of it by now (different types of tomatoes, red bell pepper or not, basil or not) and basically just eyeball it at this point. It is my favourite meal to make, along with some fresh-baked sourdough bread. Thank you, BA.,Can I make this ahead and reheat? ,I love this recipe and have made it several times with produce from my garden. It's time consuming to get the browning on the zucchini and eggplant, but it makes a huge difference to the flavor. I haven't added basil at the end because the flavors are so perfectly balanced without it. I also slice my cherry tomatoes in half because I don't enjoy the pop of hot tomato juice, but that's just personal preference.,Super delicious. I was cautious with the olive oil and used Diamond Crystal salt, and everything was seasoned very well. The basil is a necessity! ,I tried this with my boyfriend last night! We decided to add slices of lemon in the dish right before putting it into the oven which added amazing flavour! Thinking of adding baby corn next time too for more of a crunch! My boyfriend loved it and I think I finally found the way to his heart! Gonna have an interesting night after this as a reward!,I keep coming back to this recipe over and over again. It is amazing. Although maybe using a little less oil and salt It's better. ,It's great for my keto diet. I add seasonings and salt by my intuition, I love it.,So oily and way too salty. I followed the recipe exactly and had high hopes. It didn’t taste as good as I had hoped. Too bad! ,This recipe is delicious. I used less olive oil, more garlic and dried thyme instead of fresh -- and served with a crisp flatbread to scoop. Will serve again without the basil because it overwhelms the subtle flavors. Can't wait to have the leftovers.,Just made this recipe, came out tasting amazing. I didn't have a dutch oven so I just transferred to a baking dish. Will definitely make again!,I don't have zucchini what can I replace it with for this recipe  I would really like to make it today I have everything else! ,Delicious. Mine was much less oily than the photo, perhaps because I added less oil. Didn’t have eggplant so subbed in sweet potato and added leftover baguette that I’d torn into chunks. I used this as a bed for a piece of fish and topped with rocket. So good. Needed a dollop of chilli because I’d been too heavy handed with the chilli flakes, as per. ,I am thrilled by this!  I have a Ratatouille recipe from a cookbook from 1978 with pretty much the same ingredients but it is made with tomato sauce not fresh tomatoes!   This is SUCH an improvement!!!!  I made it exactly as-is because it contains none of the food ingredients I have to avoid!  The vegetables taste phenomenal.  You won't be disappointed.,I skipped the peppers because, well, I hate peppers. Still worked! Would make again -- a great vegetarian main."

When I know I'm going to be busy I will make a batch or two to keep in the freezer so I can always have them on hand!,Not enough wet ingredients, these didn't rise anywhere near enough based on other recipes I've made (and the comments below where everyone is adding in milk etc)  I'd say they were too heavy for the tiny bit of baking powder :(  also ba please use grams it's really annoying having to convert everything.,I didnt have kosher salt and had to substitute table salt and they came out too salty. In the future would cut salt by half. ,Hi! What is the batter supposed to be like? For me it was almost like cookie dough had to scoop. I used full fat Greek yogurt and added a splash of milk to be able to fold. The raw batter tastes good... ha,Oh my goodness, these are amazing! Unfortunately, due to the quarantine, I couldn't get my hands on any whole wheat flour but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My family can't get enough of them, they're so fluffy and delicious! ,I made these while trapped in my house during a shelter in place order due to the coronavirus, so I had to sub a few things lol. I used a milk/sour cream mixture to replace the yogurt, lime instead of lemon, a mix of light and dark brown sugars, and frozen blueberries instead of fresh... and to my surprise they still turned out absolutely delightful. I look forward to trying this recipe with the original ingredients.,I’ve had many blueberry muffins in my life, but these were the best ones! Received many compliments that they tasted “healthy” (the whole meal flour). These I’ll keep remaking over and over again.,I have a question - how can I covert this recipe to being gluten free? Can I use Almond flour  (i don't like to use gluten free mixes as they are very starch heavy), and no Xantham Gum either. Thanks!,The muffins came out beautifully. One thing I did wrong is used table salt in sub for kosher salt and found the muffins too salty-so others beware. I also found the muffins to be a tad on the tarter side so might use buttermilk instead or add a bit more sugar. These are definitely on the less sweet side of the muffin spectrum. ,This was 10/10. I loved it. I used all white flour and they tasted GREAT. ,Made these a few weeks ago, and I'm making it again! I love, love, love, love the bread so much, how soft and moist it is, and how nicely it complements the blueberries. I thought I could only ever eat high quality blueberry muffins from bakeries, but now I know I don't have to leave the house to get delicious blueberry muffins of my own. Thank you, Rick!,This is a great recipe. The ingredient amounts were spot-on, and the muffins were very easy to make. Based on a previous review, since I needed to substitute ground nutmeg for fresh, I decided to only use 1/4th tsp, but as I ended up not being able to taste the nutmeg at all, I would definitely use at least 1/2 tsp if I made them again. As far as character, this recipe had everything I was looking for, but although the muffins were good, the yogurt made them a bit too tart for my taste. The next time I make them I think I will try substituting the yogurt with either buttermilk or whole milk, but this recipe is certainly worth making as it is written.,Surprisingly simple to make, and simply DELICIOUS!,Great, crunchy tops! Really fantastic blueberry muffins.,i made these a couple of months ago - they came out great. i didn't have fresh grated nutmeg so i used it from a spice jar and for me personally, the taste was way too overpowering. my entire house smelled like nutmeg. i'll definitely make these again sans nutmeg though"

I think flax meal is a good substitute especially since it is more common in my household since I use it in overnight oats and regular hot oatmeal. But be careful when using flax meal/seeds in general as they are another type of binding agent. Pancakes kept me full and had a great, seedy crunch, adding some much needed fiber and heft to this breakfast food that usually leaves you hungry after a short while.

I also increase the cornstarch to be a heaping quarter cup because otherwise it's a tad too runny. ,The pie came out great! The only change I would make would be to reduce the amount of ginger in the pie by a tsp or 2. When eaten 4 hours after resting, the ginger was overpowering and needed some vanilla ice cream to tone down the flavor. However when eaten the day after from the fridge it was perfect.

Would definitely make again with less ginger.,My Boy made this and it rocked!,I am definitely not a baker, but this pie is so super simple and delicious it has become one of my favorite things. I've made it 3-4 times, and have shared it with friends as well as bringing one into work. Everyone raved about it and I have gotten lots of compliments. (Always make sure to mention I found the recipe on BA.)
The crust is very simple to make, and making it a few times now has really honed my skill. I have found that I sometimes have to add just a half tablespoon or so more water to the crust when making it. 
The ginger is such a good compliment to the super sweet blueberry and the lime rounds it out so well. 
The finished pie is saucy, but not too wet, and is amazing with a dollop of greek yogurt (plain or vanilla) on top. I now always check the price of blueberries and when they're on sale I have an excuse to make this delicious pie!,This pie is, how do you say? Dope! I made this a month or two ago and I'm making it again tonight. Love the addition of the ginger. It takes it to the next level for me. ,I was really disappointed with this one. I didn't love the citrus flavor mixing with the ginger. My husband LOVED it, but none of my coworkers ate it when I brought it in. Overall, I'm going to skip this one in the future.,oh...yes. Update...This was a good pie! huckleberries had a lot of twang soo good. I have another one in the oven as I type lol.,So i am currently making this pie(in the oven right now)...but instead of Blueberries i am using Huckleberries. hoping this comes out just as good as your BB pie. Huckleberries do produce a little more juice so i did add a little more cornstarch and a little sprinkle of flour over the top so that it can set properly.  I will let you know how it turns out! 

...ALSO! Brad and Vinny need to come to Montana and do a Alive! Episode doing fly fishing and huckleberry picking.,Super delicious! I am living in the UK, and the style of oven here is a bit different; my settings were 175 degrees C, bottom heating only for the first 45 minutes, then top and bottom for the last 45 minutes. Turned out beautifully golden brown! I also used brown sugar instead of granulated or demerara, and it was a fine substitute. The notes of ginger were pretty subtle (to be fair, I love ginger), so next time I would likely double, or triple, the ginger. ,How much flour is in the crust recipe?  There's no amount listed in the ingredient list.,Nice twist on a BB pie, but next time, I’d use a bit less ginger as it was a little overpowering for my tastes. Still a good pie, but would rather taste more blueberry. ,Where are the instructions on how to make the crust?? ,I love this pie"

Used the last of my parsley, which was about 3/4 cup, and used about a tsp of dried dill to make up the difference. I used regular Dijon mustard and red wine vinegar, because that just happens to be what I have on hand. I also added very finely diced red pepper (about 3 tbsp) and one finely diced stalk of celery because I had them. I also used 3 small gherkins, because I don't have dill pickles. I also used scallions instead of chives.

This recipe is honestly great despite its bad reviews which if i had noticed the rating this recipe had I probably wouldn't have actually made it. I'm asking anyone who is thinking about this recipe to give it a try and ignore the bare reviews. I like this bread so much I'm making two more loaves today after I made one just yesterday.,I had to sub in 1/2 cup of milk since I didn't have powdered, and I dialed back the salt a bit since I only had fine sea salt, but it turned out great! Looking forward to making this again when I have some better ingredients. ,I don't get the poor reviews, this was very easy and turned out great for me! You should try it 😄

I have to guess that either...

1. People miss the step where the recipe asks you to bloom the yeast in warm water. This is where most of the hydration comes from.

2. People are using table salt instead of kosher salt. (OR they got tripped up by the difference between Diamond Crystal and Morton's kosher salts. The latter is much saltier by volume.),Yeast bread recipes are not an exact science.  So much depends on the flour you use, the humidity in your home, and your experience as a bread baker. I've made this twice and it's a good, solid recipe - but I can see where a novice bread maker could trip up.  Don't overlook the cup of warm water used to proof the yeast! No liquids are listed in the ingredients and it could be easy to miss.  Use 1 TBSP *kosher* salt, not table salt. If you substitute table salt, cut back the amount by about half.  Bread flour behaves differently than all purpose flour and the amount you use will vary.  3.5 cups is a suggestion.  Experience tells you when the dough is hydrated just right. For me, the dough feels slightly moist and silky.  If you don't have the touch yet, knead the dough - don't use the stand mixer and dough hook until you know how it feels.  

Don't be put off by bad reviews here - give this a try for yourself!  ,I love this bread recipe and have made it several times. I disagree with most of the comments here ( as most aren't even helpful). The recipe works well as is except for one detail: they overestimate how moist the dough turns out. I find that having a cup of warm water nearby and adding as needed when you are kneading the dough produces a good loaf. I also make sure that my bread isn't over-kneaded using the window-pane test. Another thing that might affect your loafs is the temp and humidity of your kitchen. If your house runs cold and dry like mine, your dough won't rise. You can make a mini proofer by boiling a pot of water and placing said boiling pot into the oven. This traps the heat and humidity, allowing for a the dough to rise as intended. ,I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. Dough needed more hydration. My loaf turned out pretty dense and lacked flavor. Extended proofing time to get more rise, but didn’t get much. ,This is the worst bread recipe I have ever attempted. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!!,I made this with milk instead of milk powder & accidentally used too much water, but it worked out! I used the amount of water in the recipe and then about a quarter cup of milk, and the dough started dry but ended up perfect! I got a great rise from both proofs, and the bread ended up just a little dry, but good density and rise over the pan. Love this recipe; I'm gonna tweak it to get more moisture next time!,Ditto to the other reviews.  My dough was super piecey so added a little more water.  My apt gets super warm in the summer but I had to let it rise for 3 hours and it never made it to double it's size.  Probs won't be using this recipe again.  BUT I generally love Bon Appetit recipes so I'm assuming this is just a bad apple.  Pun intended.,I’ve baked this recipe twice—both disappointments. This recipe produces a squat, heavy, gluey loaf with little flavor. The rise/proof times are off by 100%. How is that possible? Do you try these recipes before you publish them? I have never used a BA recipe that was successful, and I won’t be trying again. I gave this recipe 1 star simply because it didn’t burst into flames. ,Heyyyyy - 1 TBSP of salt is pretty aggressive for this loaf. I'd knock it back down to 1 tsp, maybe 2 tsp if you like salty bread. I love salty bread, but this is too much. I had a pretty hard time getting a good rise from it as well, and that could be due to the salt content...but not positive about that. 

And for folks trying to estimate how long this recipe takes, the times given for the rise are a little slim (though of course this depends on how warm your house is, your yeast, how many pounds of salt you're packing into this loaf). I made this loaf on a warm day, proofed it on top of my warm oven, and the first rise took about 2 1/2 hours, and proofing took another 2 hours, but I should have let it go longer. My loaf is a little squat.

So yeah, some issues with this one.

I will keep making these though, and maybe experiment with the temp or pan size. "

Leaving the cake in the pan to cool and soaking it with the coffee sugar mixture is key to a moist cake, just be sure to check periodically while baking as to not over bake. Mine baked for 45 minutes in a convection oven. The chocolate coating is divine!,I'm an experienced baker and I had to make this twice. The first time, even though I used the correct size pan, it overflowed and my cake was a disaster. The second time I added a foil collar yo the sides of my pan and the cake didn't overflow, but it is slightly concave. I tasted the first one before I tossed it and it tastes good, so I know the cake eill be tasty, but it's not pretty. I don't know if I will make it again, depends on the reviews tonight, but so far am not impressed.

Continue stirring, slapping dough against sides of saucepan with spoon, until dough leaves a thick film on bottom of pan and pulls away from sides, about 3 minutes (the important thing here is to cook the flour and dry out the dough). Transfer to a medium bowl and let rest 3 minutes.,Using a wooden spoon, mix 5 eggs into dough one at a time, making sure to completely incorporate each egg before adding the next. Dough will look broken when eggs are added, but will come back together as you stir. The final texture should be smooth, glossy, and somewhat stretchy.,Fit pastry bag with round tip. Spoon dough into bag. Holding bag at an angle so the tip is just touching prepared baking sheet on one side, gently start to squeeze out dough. Without moving the tip (this will help you make a perfect circle), pipe dough until you have a 1½"" round (you can trace circles on the back of the parchment for extra accuracy). Repeat, staggering rounds and spacing 2"" apart.,Beat remaining egg in a small bowl until no streaks remain and lightly brush tops of dough. Bake 15 minutes, then lower heat to 350˚. Continue to bake until puffs are deep golden brown all over and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, 10–15 minutes.,Do Ahead:, Dough can be made 1 day ahead; transfer to pastry bag and chill. Puffs can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Reheat at 350° for 5 minutes to crisp; puffs are easier to fill when firm.,Place milk, butter, and salt in a medium saucepan, then scrape in vanilla seeds and add pod. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.,Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks and granulated sugar in a medium bowl until very pale and light, about 3 minutes. Add cornstarch, whisking until no powdery dry spots remain. Whisking constantly, gradually add hot milk mixture to egg mixture. Transfer back to saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture is thick and holds whisk marks, about 2 minutes.,Strain custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Cover with plastic, pressing directly onto surface; chill until cold, at least 2 hours.,Fit pastry bag with star tip. Transfer chilled pastry cream to bag. Working one at a time, poke a hole into the bottom of each puff with a paring knife. Gently pipe in pastry cream to fill. Puffs will begin to get soggy as soon as they are filled, so wait until just before serving to add pastry cream.,Do Ahead:, Pastry cream can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to pastry bag and chill.,Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and trace an 8"" circle on parchment; turn it over (the circle will still be visible; this is just a guide).,Fill a large bowl with ice water. Bring sugar, corn syrup, and ½ cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Boil, brushing down sides with a damp pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally (do not stir), until caramel turns a light amber color. Set bottom of saucepan in ice water to stop the cooking and firm caramel slightly (if caramel is too thin, it will be runny and drip too much).,Carefully dip tops of filled puffs in caramel and place, caramel side up, on an unlined rimmed baking sheet; let sit until caramel is set. (If caramel becomes too hard before all puffs are dipped, reheat over medium-low to loosen.),Use the 12 largest puffs for the bottom layer of your croquembouche. Working quickly, dip the side of 1 puff into caramel (you want just enough caramel to allow you to “glue” puffs together) and stick hot caramel side down onto parchment just inside the 8"" circle; the top of the puff should be facing out. Dip another puff in caramel on the side in two places (at 9 o’clock and 6 o’clock) and position on parchment so that 1 spot of hot caramel will adhere to the side of the first puff and the other spot is on the parchment (again, top of puff should be facing out). Using the circle as your guide, repeat with remaining 10 puffs to complete your bottom layer.,Set out 11 puffs to make the second layer (you may not need all of them) and use caramel to stick them together the same way as the first layer, doing your best to anchor puffs in the spaces in between the bottom puffs (this will make the croquembouche more sturdy).,Continue to build croquembouche, making slightly smaller circles for each layer and reheating caramel as needed. Finish tower with a single puff; you should have about 8 layers total.,Once croquembouche is assembled, let caramel in pan cool until it just begins to form a thread when you lift it from the pot with a fork. (The cooler it gets, the faster it will harden until it hardens mid-air.) Dip fork in caramel and quickly circle over and around croquembouche, letting caramel fall where it may (puffs should be encased in airy strings of caramel when you are done). Let caramel cool to harden.,Do Ahead:, Croquembouche can be assembled 8 hours ahead. Chill until ready to serve.",April 2015,2.42,"Everyone saying the choux is too wet must not be cooking out their flour enough. I doubled the recipe and used all the ingredients as they were listed and they came out perfect. Doubling the recipe I ended up with about 90 puffs. I did have to cook them longer than it said, but that could be my oven. I also recommend baking on a silpat as opposed to parchment because I found my ones baked on parchment got darker on the bottom than they did on the silpat.  Use a stand mixer to incorporate the eggs it is much easier. ,I was planning on making a croquembouche for Christmas Eve. I decided to make the puffs on the 23rd, then fill and assemble on the 24th. So I made the dough, and it was very different than all the other times I’ve made cream puffs. It was a bit runny and has way more eggs than other recipes. So I baked at 425 for 15 minutes, then dropped the oven to 350. I was planning on checking after 10 minutes, but at minute 6 my fire alarm went off. All the cream puffs were completely burned and not salvageable. So I went out and bought a cake. Next time I’ll use Sally’s Baking Addiction recipe for pate a choux. ,I had no problems with this recipe, the batter was exactly as described, using all 5 eggs. I ended up with about 60 and made a croquembouche with 7 layers. It should be noted that the ingredients for the puff batter are the same as other cream puffs on this site that have great reviews. The video on the plain cream puff recipe is very helpful, making sure to cook the batter enough and also using a stand mixer to incorporate the eggs. I'm very happy and impressed with the final product. ,DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE. I wasted a lot of time, effort and good organic eggs, butter and milk because the recipe is simply OFF. The creme came out very well. But the pate a choux. NO NO NO. I finally went on youtune (third try) and used a French pastry chef's recipe that was simple and came out finally.  This recipe should be taken down. I am surprised as i trust bon appetit , but there is clearly something very wrong here. I ended up having the chou, stuffed them with cream and just arranged them on a plate and put some melted chocolate on them to serve.  Never got far enough to mount.  Just ran out of time and was very frustrated. ,Also, I used 3 eggs and one egg yolk. I got this tip from other recipes and forums on the internet. Hope this helps!!! ,This recipe is horrible. Not only does the batter come out runny, you cannot get 40-50 puffs with it. I had to make the dough 3 times to get it right... only after reading other recipes on how to do it. It says to add water and milk to the dough, do not do this. Either split those amounts in half or just add water, that’s what I did. On my third attempt (the first two batches came out too runny) I got it right by only adding water. I got around 13 puffs from this first batch. I made a second batch and doubled it which yielded around maybe 30 puffs. Someone from BA needs to go back through and rewrite the directions as they are not helpful. This recipe was a task and finally once I figured it out, the Pate au choux came together. Hopefully this helps others in their task of trying to make this recipe. ,
Choux was much too wet with 5 large eggs. I so wish Bon appetit would use weights!
if not instead of cups then at least in addition to. It would also be good if it said approximately how many choux buns you should end up with."

This will dry out the meat and intensify the flavor of the rub.,Then freeze (still upright) until solid, at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.,Preheat oven to 200°. Pour rice bran oil or vegetable oil into a 12"" skillet, preferably cast iron, to a depth of ¾"". Oil should be deep enough to come halfway up side of steak; add a little more oil to skillet if needed.,Heat oil over medium-high until probe thermometer registers 350° (or clip a deep-fry thermometer to the side of your skillet if you prefer). Transfer steak straight from freezer to skillet and cook, turning once, until deeply browned all over and a crisp crust has formed, about 3 minutes per side.,Transfer steak back to rack on baking sheet (reserve skillet and oil) and roast in oven until no longer frozen (the interior will still be cold but thawed enough to allow the insertion of the probe thermometer), 30–35 minutes.,Meanwhile, cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until it foams, then browns, 5–8 minutes.

(You should have about ¾ tsp.) Heat oil in a medium heavy skillet (such as carbon steel or cast iron) over medium-high and add half of cabbage, cut side down (reserve remaining half for another use). Cook cabbage, undisturbed, until underside is almost blackened (the edge of the sides will start to brown as well), 10–15 minutes.,Reduce heat to medium-low, add butter to skillet, and shake pan to help butter get in, around, and under cabbage. As soon as butter is melted and foaming, tilt skillet toward you and spoon browning butter over cabbage, being sure to bathe the area around the core (thick and dense, this part will take the longest to cook), 30 seconds. Stop basting and let cabbage cook, undisturbed, 3 minutes, then baste again, 30 seconds more. Repeat cooking and basting process twice more (butter will continue to get darker as it cooks, and that's okay; add a knob or two more to bring it back from the brink), adding kelp to brown butter just before final basting. At this point, cabbage should be tender (a cake tester or skewer inserted into the core should meet with no resistance) and the outer leaves have pulled away from one another. If cabbage is not done, repeat cooking and basting process once more.,Transfer cabbage to a cutting board and cut into two quarters. Pull leaves open slightly and tuck basil here and there between a few leaves. Drizzle with vinegar and season with salt. Let cabbage sit a minute or two for basil to soften before serving.",April 2015,3.34,"I made this with a few adjustments based on the comments, and it was outstanding.  I quartered a cabbage, put all four quarters in the pan and blackened both cut sides, it took about 8 minutes per side.  Then dropped in a whole stick of butter, yikes steam steam steam!!!  Basted the quarters awhile then turned them over to the other cut side and basted some more.  The cabbage did soften perfectly this way.  Finished with some seaweed/sesame rice topping, I love sesame with cabbage, and wow yum yum.  It looks burnt like it was ruined, but is sort of attractive, and tastes absolutely heavenly.,This is not the best recipe, but with a few tweaks it turned out great. I followed the recipe, basting in a few rounds, and thought the cabbage would be done, but using a cake tester I could feel that the cabbage was still raw inside. I put a lid on the pan to help steam the cabbage from the top which helped, but eventually I ended up taking it out of the pan, cutting it in half and putting the halves back in the pan with the newly cut sides down. Doing this along with basting and putting the lid on in between helped it cook through. I was worried it was going to taste burnt since I was cooking the butter for so long, but it turned out delicious. I loved the addition of vinegar and salt at the end and skipped the basil since I didn’t have any. I would make this again with the same modifications."

I used an eleven inch tart pan and made a simple linear design on top.  It looked very elegant, and was all gone within a very short amount of time.  ,Delicious, easy to put together, gorgeous out of the pan.

I watched the video, which I never do and it was fun and helpful."

Don't sleep on the pistou, it adds brightness and is super easy to put together while the kale is wilting in the soup. All in all, this is a hearty, delicious soup that hits all the right spots!,The pistou really carries this, but that's not saying the base is bad. the parmesan rind lends a lot of flavor. I did up the garlic a little.,delish! flavorful and hearty,This was SO GOOD. The pancetta and Parmesan rind really make this, so don’t skip those elements but this has such a rich flavor for being made of all healthy ingredients. ,this is a very good soup for me and my family. would recommend. 5 stars out of 5. winner takes it all.,This soup is now one of my go-tos for cold days. It's hearty and delicious, easily made vegetarian and the pistou is great with bread, too.,One of the best soups I've ever made. People love it. Freezes beautifully."

The cooking method was quick and simple enough for a weeknight, but the flavor made it feel like a real treat. Great alongside roasted root vegetables. ,Trichinosis is caused by the trichinosis worm, NOT a tapeworm. More specifically, it is caused by roundworms of the Trichinella type.  It is NOT a bacteria. It is an extremely dangerous parasitic condition that can easily cause death if not diagnosed and treated promptly.,Also a few mods — I used bison tallow and ghee ,Just made this :20 ago, and I had to write about it. This is the best cast iron pork chop recipe around, it’s frickin perfect. Easy for a guys night too simple to make and super satisfying. The key is to salt pepper and herb it up (used Maldon salt, pepper and simply Organic’s garlic and herb mixture) and KEEP flipping it every minute. The pan sauce was perfect too. I will absolutely make this again. Bon appetit 🙌,This is a simple, delicious recipe. Responding to Anonymous #2, the French method of cooking is to use plain vegetable oil so that it doesn't leave an unwanted taste footprint. There are certainly other oils that are considered to be more healthy, but ones such as olive oil have a distinct flavor that may  negatively impact the flavor profile of the dish. If you knew anything about self-respecting chefs you'd know this.,My husband made this with some local pork. It was delightful. I am sure that it will become a regular at our home.,First, trichinosis is caused by a tapeworm larva, not bacteria as you state.  Second, people still do develop trichinosis in the U.S., sometimes from pork or bear meat prepared here, but perhaps more often from meat eaten abroad and not properly cooked.  As the disease takes a little while to develop the diagnosis may only be made here. Third, you can die from trichinosis or have severe brain damage.  Please do some research before making statements.   Other than that, I still prefer braising in a sauce made with red or black currants.  Very tender and not dry.,Replace the vegetable oil (I can't imagine why any self respecting chef would recommend vegetable oil for ANYTHING), and you have yourself a winner! Juicy and flavourful. "

Then fold in butter, followed by ¾ cup raspberries, taking care not to crush berries. Scrape batter into prepared pan and scatter remaining ¼ cup raspberries over top.,Bake cake until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50–60 minutes. Let cool at least 20 minutes before unmolding.,Do Ahead:, Cake can be made 2 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.",March 2015,3.64,"So tasty! Added lemon zest and used blueberries instead of raspberries since that’s all we had. Great texture and not overly sweet. Would make again,So easy to make and I can see how many varieties I can make from this recipe! I followed the suggestion of adding lemon juice and loved it. It tastes like raspberry lemonade cake.,Amazing. Five stars. Super easy and quick and tasty. Added to my personal cookbook of favorites!,Have made this cake countless times in the last few years.  After baking the first time exactly per the recipe, I have been adding zest of one lemon to the dry ingredients and juice of one lemon to the wet, and those changes took the cake from fantastic to extraordinary.  Always use fresh raspberries and add more than the recipe calls for.  Usually bakes in about 50-52 minutes.  This is a go-to favorite.,Fantastic recipe.  Make sure you don't forget the second ""wet ingredient"" step with the butter !  (I did, and ended up fishing the batter out of the oven a minute after putting the cake pan in there... wont repeat that mistake).  I added a bunch of lemon zest and extra raspberries (probably about 1.75 C total).  The cake turns out super dense and filling and makes about 12 thin servings (really, a small slice is enough!).  The lemon really makes the raspberry pop and the cake has wonderful texture.  You can't really taste the ricotta cheese.  For an extra sweetness, I also made a simple lemon icing for people to drizzle on top.  I'm definitely keeping this cake in the repertoire, my friends were going nuts. ,Decent cake, in our opinion. I would add in another flavor as on its own, it can be bland other than the fruit. Perhaps lemon zest, rose water, more vanilla. The texture can be a bit grainy. And lastly, it DEFINITELY needs to be paired with a whipped cream. ,I was sceptical of this recipe but it turned out really well with some minor adjustments! I cut down on the butter to a little less than 1/4 cup and the sugar to 1/2 cup. I like the texture of the cake too! So yum! ,This really is a no-fail cake - I misread the recipe and used baking soda instead of baking powder, threw in more raspberries than the recipe calls for and I'm pretty sure I used the wrong size cake pan. Still came out great!,The nutritional values listed on this recipe annoyed me so much that I used the nutritional calculator at WebMD to calculate the calories, fat, and carbs in all the ingredients (except baking powder, salt, and vanilla). In a nutshell, while the recipe says it serves 8, the nutritional value they show is for 1/4th the recipe, or two of their 8 slices.  Divided by 8, it's about 400 calories, 46 carbs, and 20 g fat, according to the WebMD calculator.  ,This is my family's favorite cake.  I have used raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and our favorite, all three at once.  It is dense and rich.  I do also add about a teaspoon of lemon zest to brighten the berry flavor.,Made this yesterday and used fresh raspberries.  Baked for 50 minutes and it was perfect.  I can't wait to try it with other types of fruit.  YUM  ,I've made this a handful of times with great success. The most recent (adapted) version I just pulled out of the oven is healthier and honestly we could not tell a difference from the first cake (for which I followed the recipe verbatim).
My swaps: 
1) 6 tbsp olive oil in place of the butter, stirred in with the wet ingredients
2) Replaced 1/2C ap flour with 1/2C whole wheat flour
3) Cut the sugar by 1/4C (used 3/4C sugar)
4) + lemon zest from 1/2 lemon 
5) 1.5C berries (I used strawberries. Increasing the fruit kept the sweetness level just right),This cake was ok. It didn't have all that much flavor except for the raspberries and if I make it again, I would add lemon zest to the batter. It never got very solid even when very brown on top, and I had to throw some out because it was raw! Maybe I did something wrong, but I have made similar recipes and this one did not work out for me.,Does anyone ever answer a question here or are the reviews just for commenting?
The nutritional values seem way off.  There couldn't possibly be that many calories in one slice but there couldn't possibly that few in the entire cake. Right? Also almost all of the other values seem way off. I would love to bake this cake but not at that many calories a slice! Also how many slices in the cake? If you could get back to me by tomorrow morning I would very much appreciate it. I am going to my parents tomorrow and would like to bring this for brunch. Thank you in advance.,Yom. The texture reminds me of cornbread? Maybe next time i’ll try it in a cast iron skillet with bacon grease?,Made it for first time tonight, only thing I changed was I made it in a bunt pan, cooked a little less time,turned out delicious, thank you for my new favourite recipe😀❤,I made the mistake of over mixing so parts of it ended up a bit on the chewy side, but it was still delicious! Since I know where I went wrong, the problem is easily fixed and I'll be adding this to my cake options when I get invited to spring events! I did add 1 tsps of lemon extract as an experiment, which enhanced the flavors without turning the cake too lemony. I'll be experimenting with orange zest  and blackberries next!,I messed it up a little bit (the cake was too moist, in case you didn't know it was possible) and didn't get baked all the way through. Still the most delicious addition to last year's Easter brunch, then to my breakfast a few weeks later, then to my West Wing binge watching. Make this, you won't look back. ,i might throw in some lime zest and ghost chili -- just a touch of the chili.  (or maybe a milder chili or ground white pepper instead of Caspar lol).  i just can't leave well enough alone.  (i'd add mint if i had any)  {or maybe just whipped heavy cream on the side, zest and pepper mixed in}

just call me ""or maybe ...,This cake is the perfect blend of sweet and tart.  I just made it for the second time; and my husband, who is usually ""chocolate or nothing,"" had three pieces.  I made sure all ingredients were room temp, and I got the most amazing texture.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!,Fabulous cake that came together easily with ingredients on hand!  Used frozen mixed berries otherwise followed directions. Just the right amount of sweet for someone who doesn'r have a sweet tooth.  Served with vanilla ice cream for the kids Leftovers great for breakfast with coffee!  It's a keeper!,WOW, what a nice flavour!  Followed recipe, used fresh raspberries, found it took about 55 minutes to cook.  Looks just like the picture.  Dense but very nice, even without the whip cream.  For entertaining, I would do the whip cream and fresh raspberries to top it.  I went back for 2nd piece and still want another!  Looking good for breakfast! Definitely adding this to my collection of fav’s! ❤️,I dont know what I did wrong, but the cake turned out to be a pudding. A delicious pudding though! :)) I would definitely make it again, see if I nail it next time. And I would use fresh raspberries instead.,it's a wonderful cake very easy to make but I had problem with the time of the cooking. After one hour it's still undone in the lower part. It might depends on my oven or the even from the pan
,Made this cake countless times, and it always comes out delicious. I have only ever used frozen raspberries and typically add a little bit more than is called for. Sometimes I'll mix in lemon zest. Always comes together quickly and easily. very, very, very delicious!"

Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium. Cook pork, turning often, until evenly browned, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a platter and pour off pan drippings.,Wipe out any burned bits from pot, but leave the golden-brown pieces (doing this will keep the finished sauce from tasting bitter).

Scatter parsley and more Parmesan over top and drizzle with oil.",March 2015,4.01,"AMAZINGLY GREAT! I loved this and I rarely post reviews but this is a must. Easy, delicious and the sauce is so good I am going to cook a batch for pasta and homemade pizza.  I am not one to follow recipes...I always add this or that and this time I decided to follow it to the tee...well almost. I had to add 1/2 teaspoon (or more)...of red pepper flakes and instead of using canned tomatoes I used fresh little ones and placed them in my smoothie machine and pulsed them until they were crushed. Again, thanks for making my day! OH YEAH, the polenta was to die for. I fried a slice in the morning with an egg on time, brought back mouth-watering memories of the full meal deal I had eaten the night before.,Fantastic flavors for the Pork Ragu.   I put mine over homemade cornbread because I had corn meal and no polenta and it's quarantine cooking....  Will have to try with polenta another time.  Also didn't have fresh thyme so used dried.  I did have fresh Rosemary and used two good sized sprigs.  
I ended up cutting my meat into more than three pieces to even out their sizes.  It helped keep them more submerged in the liquid since they were smaller and probably cut down on the cooking time but it did take the full three hours plus a bit more.  Over all great flavor and I'll add this to my staples.,Excellent recipe - definitely a weekend meal though. I found to get the right consistency, flavor, and sauce thickness I had to braise it for about 4 hours. I used a cab-syrah blend for the wine which seemed to work well. I'm curious if I could prep on the stove top and then chuck into my instant pot - cook - then pull out the meat and sautee to reduce the sauce down. Alternatively maybe an oven braise at low heat would yield a more tender end product. Looking forward to experimenting with this one in future. ,Amazingly delicious. Followed the recipe exactly, and the allowed the meat to simmer uncovered in the sauce after I shredded it to thicken the sauce up a bit. Made for guests (one of whom doesn't usually love pork) and they loved it too. Served the red wine that I used in the sauce with it as well. Will be making again for sure. ,Reliable and delicious, the perfect cozy thing to have simmering on your stove on a cold winter day.,I was really dubious about this recipe because I'm not a huge pork fan, but it turned out amazing and I'll make it again! The meat turned out tender and flavorful, and the sauce is really savory and flavorful from all the layers of seasoning. For the final step of braising the meat in the sauce, I put it in the crockpot on low, and it worked really well. The only thing I didn't care for was the texture of the whole (although crushed) tomatoes. Next time I'll use diced. Additionally, I made the mistake of adding too much salt to the polenta water - do not add salt as though you are cooking pasta, haha! Can't wait to make this again!  ,Rarely post reviews, but this is worth one. I tracked the recipe closely, braised it in the oven, and served the ragu over grits.  Everyone thought it was very good - perfect for a cold and wet day.  Will definitely make this again. Great foundational recipe to riff from. ,Loved this recipe! I followed the pork ragu recipe carefully but added some broth to the polenta for extra flavor. It was the perfect elevated comfort food for the latest blast of cold weather. Also, it smells wonderful the enture time it is braising and the smell lingers for some time. Will make this again soon.,I couldn’t wait to make it and it delivered.  Fabulous!  The pork ragu with grated Parmesan also made for a great play on Huevos Rancheros when served over sunny-side up eggs on top of corn tortillas.,For anyone else who’s curious as to how this would turn out in an Instant Pot... I followed instructions until “bring to a boil and simmer,” at which point I tossed it all in the Instant Pot on high pressure for 40 min. Should have known the sauce wouldn’t set BUT the pork was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth tender and the flavor was incredible. That was great but not really a true Ragu to me, so next time (and the time after that, as I’m sure this will be in regular rotation) I’ll make it in the dutch oven. ,Probably one of my fave meals. I made the pork shoulder pretty much exactly how it's written, and let it cook for a full 3 hours. I shredded the pork after 2.5 hours though and let it cook shredded for the last 30 min to make sure the middle sections got to tenderize in the broth. 

For the polenta I usually add an equal part of gruyere to the parmesan, and mix in mascarpone cheese. Yes, it is sinfully good but also super heavy (definitely worth it though for the cheesiest, creamiest polenta ever).,One of my favorite foods to make during the cold months! I find that the polenta cooks much quicker than stated in the recipe? Not sure why. Regardless, this is a keeper. Not only that, it's good enough for guests!,Thoughts on making the pork in an Instant Pot?,I cheated a little with this one and used Trader Joe's carnitas. But the recipe was just absolute perfection and definitely a keeper. "

The only thing that I would warn is that the recipe time is very misleading. Both times I’ve made it I’ve had to add at least 60 min to the cook time, so it’s more like 1 hour 35 min to1 hour 40 min cook time instead of the 35-40 min the recipe says. When I made it over Christmas I added 2 additional hours to the cook time so plan on allowing more time for cooking! ,This is definitely a sum greater than its parts. Like the flavor is beyond anything you would imagine. A little process heavy but worth every ounce.,This has become my go-to base for all quiche recipes. Made in its original form it is perfection too. I would never recommend the minced garlic substitute suggested by another reviewer. The caramelized garlic is the star. ,Tasty! Adapted with already minced garlic.,Delicious! The tart is incredibly rich, but worth the effort. My crust slumped a bit, but was still crisp and buttery.

,I had to add a bit of water to thin out the tahini, but I love this flavor combo--definitely yummy with the halloumi grain bowl as in the photo. ,Hey! havent made, but WHAT salad is this under the dressing? XOXO ,I used this recipe as a base for my own riff - I thought, as is, it might be a little plain. So I added (without measuring) the ingredients listed above to a food processor, plus some quickly roasted chopped garlic, ginger, and green onion whites; honey; and some apple cider vin (to tie into my dish), plus some water to thin. I think the added acidity of the ACV plus the sweetness of the honey really made a big difference. Super yummy!"
